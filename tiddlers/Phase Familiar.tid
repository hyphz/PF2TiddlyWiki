''Trigger'' Your familiar would take damage.

You draw upon your patronâ€™s power to momentarily shift your familiar from its solid, physical form into an ephemeral version of itself shaped of mist. 

Your familiar gains resistance 5 to all damage and is immune to precision damage. These apply only against the triggering damage.

''Heightened (+1)'' Increase the resistance by 2.
