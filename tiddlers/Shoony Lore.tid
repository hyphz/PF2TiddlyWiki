Growing up in shoony society, you learned the value of honesty, friendship, and hard work, even during trying times. 

You gain the trained proficiency rank in [[Diplomacy]] and [[Survival]]. If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. 

You also become trained in Shoony [[Lore]].
