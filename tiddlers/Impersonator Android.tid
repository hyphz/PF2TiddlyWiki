You become trained in [[Deception]] (or another skill if you’re already trained in Deception). You don’t require a disguise kit when attempting [[Deception]] checks to [[Impersonate]] a human. In addition, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to Impersonate checks to pretend that you’re a human version of yourself, rather than an android. This bonus doesn’t apply to other checks to Impersonate humans.
