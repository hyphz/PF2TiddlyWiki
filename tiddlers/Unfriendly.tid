__This condition reflects a creature’s disposition toward a particular character, and only supernatural effects (like a spell) can impose these conditions on player characters.__

A creature that is unfriendly to a character dislikes and specifically distrusts that character. 

The unfriendly creature won’t accept [[Request]]s from the character.
