''Requirements'' You are [[Hidden]] from or [[Undetected]] by all of your opponents, and you arenâ€™t within 10 feet of any enemy.

You leap from the shadows to strike your foes. 

[[Stride]] up to your Speed, then [[Strike]] twice. 

If you were hidden or unnoticed by the target of these Strikes, your foe is [[Flat-Footed]] against both attacks. 

Your [[Multiple Attack Penalty]] applies normally for both attacks.
