Although you may not even be aware, the alghollthus your ancestors once served maintain a stranglehold on the deepest, tethered parts of your mind. 

You receive a +2 circumstance bonus to [[Will]] saves against <<tag Mental>> effects that would make you [[Controlled]], and if you roll a success against such an effect, you get a critical success instead. 

However, you gain none of these benefits against effects originating from alghollthus and instead take a â€“2 circumstance penalty against mental effects from alghollthus.
