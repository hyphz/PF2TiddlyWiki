A fortune effect beneficially alters how you roll your dice. 

You can never have more than one fortune effect alter a single roll. If multiple fortune
effects would apply, you have to pick which to use. 

If a fortune effect and a misfortune effect would apply to the same roll, the two cancel each other out, and you roll normally.
