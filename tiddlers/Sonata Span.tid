{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

By playing a brief tune on an instrument or in song, you cause the notes of the melody to physically manifest into a shimmering, translucent path. 

This path doesnâ€™t need to be over solid ground and can tilt up or down diagonally up to 45 degrees, but it must be a straight, 5-foot-wide line.

It can support as many creatures as can physically fit on the bridge.
