{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

You delve into the possible futures of the next few seconds to understand all the ways your target might avoid harm, then cast out a vision of that future to those around you. 

On the first attack roll made against the target during true targetâ€™s duration, the attacker rolls twice and uses the better result. 

The attacker also ignores circumstance penalties to the attack roll and any flat check required due to the target being [[Concealed]] or [[Hidden]].
