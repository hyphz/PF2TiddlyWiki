You are at home out in the elements, reveling in the power of nature unleashed. 

You do not take circumstance penalties to ranged spell attacks or [[Perception]] checks caused by weather, and your targeted spells donâ€™t require a flat check to succeed against a target concealed by weather (such as fog).
