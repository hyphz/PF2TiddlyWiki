title: Storm Flash
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This +2 greater [[Striking]] [[Shock]] rapier has a golden blade, and miniature electric arcs flash across its guard while itâ€™s wielded. When out of its sheath under an open sky, the blade causes storm clouds to gather slowly above.

The greater Storm Flash is a +3, instead of +2.

''Activate'' {{TwoAction}} command, envision; ''Frequency'' once per day; ''Effect'' You cast a 6th-level [[Lightning Bolt]] (DC 33). If you have a greater storm flash, it's 8th level (DC 38).

''Activate'' {{ReactionIcon}} command; ''Frequency'' once per 10 minutes; ''Trigger'' An electricity effect targets you or a creature within 10 feet of you, or has you or a creature within 10 feet of you in its area; ''Effect'' You try to divert the electricity off course, to be absorbed by storm flash. Choose one eligible creature to protect and roll a melee attack roll against the DC of the electricity effect. If you succeed, the chosen creature takes no electricity damage from the triggering effect.
