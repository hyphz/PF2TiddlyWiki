type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

Your litany rails against the sin of sloth, interfering with the targetâ€™s ability to react. 

The target must attempt a [[Will]] save.

A particularly slothful creature, such as a sloth demon, uses the outcome one degree of success worse than the result of its saving throw. 

The target becomes temporarily immune to all of your litanies for 1 minute.
