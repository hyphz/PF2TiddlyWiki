{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

You draw forth a hagâ€™s innate jealousy to deny a target its greatest attribute. 

The target gains an adverse condition depending on its highest ability modifier: 

| !Highest Ability | !Condition |
|[[Strength]] |[[Enfeebled]] |
|[[Dexterity]] |[[Clumsy]] |
|[[Constitution]] |[[Drained]] |
|[[Intelligence]] |[[Stupefied]] |
|[[Wisdom]] |[[Stupefied]] |
|[[Charisma]] |[[Stupefied]] |

On a tie, the creature decides which of the conditions associated with the tied ability modifiers to take. 

The target must attempt a [[Will]] save.

{{||SaveSuccessTable}}

At the start of each of your turns, the target can attempt another Will save, ending the effect on a success.
