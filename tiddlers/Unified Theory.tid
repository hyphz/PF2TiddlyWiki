''Prerequisites'' Legendary in [[Arcana]].

Youâ€™ve started to make a meaningful connection about the common underpinnings of the four traditions of magic and magical essences, allowing you to understand them all through an arcane lens. 

Whenever you use __a skill action__ or a skill feat that requires a [[Nature]], [[Occultism]], or [[Religion]] check, depending on the magic tradition, you can use [[Arcana]] instead. 

If you would normally take a penalty or have a higher DC for using Arcana on other magic (such as when using [[Identify Magic]]), you no longer do so.
