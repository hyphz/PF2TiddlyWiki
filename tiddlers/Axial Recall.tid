title: Axial Recall
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

You have reconfigured the magical resonance of your core to attune to the planar energies of Axis. 

You can cast [[Plane Shift]] twice per week as an arcane innate spell that can only target yourself; you can travel only to Axis or the Material Plane, and your body serves as the focus component.
