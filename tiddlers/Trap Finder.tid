You have an intuitive sense that alerts you to the dangers and presence of traps. 

You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [[Perception]] checks to find traps, to [[AC]] against attacks made by traps, and to saves against traps. 

Even if you arenâ€™t [[Search]]ing, you get a check to find traps that normally require you to be Searching. You still need to meet any other requirements to find the trap.

You can disable traps that require a proficiency rank of master in [[Thievery]]. If you have master proficiency in Thievery, you can disable traps that require a proficiency rank of legendary instead, and your circumstance bonuses against traps increases to +2.
