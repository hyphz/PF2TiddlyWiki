{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

You ward the target item against those who would steal it. 

When a creature attempts to take the target into its possession, it takes 8d8 <<tag Mental>> damage and is [[Doomed]], depending on the result of its [[Will]] save. The spell then ends. 

You can choose up to 10 creatures when you cast this spell; if you do, those creatures can take the target item without triggering the ward. 

You can only have one banditâ€™s doom active at a time. If you cast the spell again, the newer casting supersedes the older.
