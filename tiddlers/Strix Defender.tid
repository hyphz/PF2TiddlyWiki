Your ancestral feud with humans gives you experience dealing with vicious foes, and your vengeance knows no bounds. 

You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [[Intimidation]], [[Perception]], and [[Survival]] checks against humans, as well as on damage rolls against humans with weapons and unarmed attacks. 

However, your hatred of humans is immediately obvious, giving you a â€“2 circumstance penalty to [[Diplomacy]] checks against them and usually starting their attitude one step worse towards you.
