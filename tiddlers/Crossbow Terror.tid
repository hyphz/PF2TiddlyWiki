You are a dynamo with the crossbow. 

You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to damage with crossbows. 

If the crossbow is a simple weapon, also increase the damage die size for your attacks made with that crossbow by one step. 

As normal, this damage die increase canâ€™t be combined with other abilities that alter the weapon damage die (such as the ranger feat [[Crossbow Ace]]).
