''Requires'' Healing Font.

''Trigger'' Any ally within 30 feet that you can heal with your [[Heal]] spell would take damage from an attack or effect from a source you can observe.

''Requirements'' You have a heal spell prepared and you arenâ€™t [[Flat-Footed]] to the source of the damage.

You cast [[Heal]] on the triggering target. Instead of its normal effects, the heal spell reduces the triggering damage by an amount equal to the Hit Points a 1-action heal spell of that level would have recovered.

As usual, if this reduces the damage to 0, it might also remove additional effects of the triggering attack, such as injury poisons.
