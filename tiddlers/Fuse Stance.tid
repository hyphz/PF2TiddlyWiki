title: Fuse Stance
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

''Prerequisites'' at least two stances.

You have combined two stances into a single stance all your own. 

When you take this feat, choose two stances you know and combine them into a single fused stance. Give your new fused stance a unique name. 

When you enter your fused stance, you gain all the effects of both stances, including the requirements and restrictions.

You canâ€™t fuse stances with fundamentally incompatible requirements or restrictions (such as [[Ironblood Stance]] and [[Crane Stance]], which both require using only one type of Strike).
