type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

You cast [[Detect Magic]] at regular intervals. 

You move at half your travel speed or slower. 

You have no chance of accidentally overlooking a magic aura at a travel speed up to 300 feet per minute, but must be traveling no more than 150 feet per minute to detect magic auras before the party moves into them.
