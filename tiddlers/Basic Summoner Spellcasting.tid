{{MulticlassBasicBoundedSpellcasting}}

You gain the [[Cast a Spell]] activity. 

Your key spellcasting ability for summoner archetype spells is [[Charisma]], and they are summoner spells of your eidolonâ€™s tradition. 

You become trained in spell attack rolls and spell DCs of that tradition. 

You gain a spell repertoire and two cantrips. 

Each time you gain a spell slot of a new level from the summoner archetype, add a spell of that level or lower to your repertoire. Each time you lose spell slots of a particular level, remove those spells from your repertoire.
