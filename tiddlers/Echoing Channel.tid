When you pull forth positive or negative energy, you also create a smaller pocket of that energy. 

If the next action you use is to cast a 2-action [[Harm]] or heal to [[Heal]] or damage a single creature, choose one additional creature adjacent to either you or the target. 

Target that creature with a 1-action version of the same spell. This spell is the same level as the 2-action harm or heal you cast and doesnâ€™t cost another spell slot.
