You wear skulls to demoralize foes. 

You become trained in [[Intimidation]] and gain the [[Intimidating Glare]] skill feat. If youâ€™re already trained in Intimidation, you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. 

If you pay 50 gp for a splendid skull mask, the mask grants you a +1 item bonus to [[Intimidation]]; its usage is worn (mask).
