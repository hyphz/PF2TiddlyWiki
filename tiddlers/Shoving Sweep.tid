''Trigger'' A creature within your reach leaves a square during a move action itâ€™s using.

''Requirements'' You are wielding a melee weapon in two hands.

You swing your weapon at your foe, rebuffing them back.

You attempt to [[Shove]] the triggering creature, ignoring the requirement that you have a hand free. 

The creature continues its movement after the Shove.
