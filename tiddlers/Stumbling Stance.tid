title: Stumbling Stance
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

You enter a seemingly unfocused stance that mimics the movements of the inebriate â€” bobbing, weaving, leaving false openings, and distracting your enemies from your true movements. 

While in this stance, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [[Deception]] checks to [[Feint]]. 

The only Strikes you can make are stumbling swing unarmed attacks. These deal 1d8 bludgeoning damage; are in the brawling group; and have the [[Agile]], [[Backstabber]], [[Finesse]], [[Nonlethal]], and [[Unarmed]] traits. 

If an enemy hits you with a melee Strike while in this stance, it becomes [[Flat-Footed]] against the next stumbling swing Strike you make against it before the end of your next turn.
