Unsuspecting targets are especially vulnerable to your poisons. 

When you successfully [[Strike]] a [[Flat-Footed]] creature with a poisoned weapon or expose a flat-footed creature to an inhaled poison, the flat-footed condition also gives that creature a â€“2 circumstance penalty to its initial save against that poison.
