title: Energy Beam
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

You can channel your coreâ€™s power through the magical gem that serves as your eye. 

You gain an energy beam ranged unarmed attack that deals 1d4 fire damage. The energy beam has a range increment of 20 feet. On a critical hit, the target takes persistent fire damage equal to the number of weapon damage dice. 

Your eye beam does not add critical specialization effects.

''[[Enhancement]]'' You channel greater power. Increase the damage die of your energy beam by one step, from 1d4 to 1d6.
