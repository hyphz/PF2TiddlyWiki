title: Ghoul Hide
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Stitched together from pieces of ghoul skin, this suit of [[+1|Armor Potency]] hide armor grants you a +1 item bonus to saving throws against disease and paralysis and makes you immune to the paralysis of ghouls. 

Ghoul hide with a [[Resilient]] rune increases the resilient runeâ€™s item bonus to saving throws against disease and paralysis by 1 (maximum +4).

Ghoul hide hisses with sibilant hatred at the touch of elves. When worn by a creature with the <<tag Elf>> trait, the armor gains the [[Noisy]] trait.
