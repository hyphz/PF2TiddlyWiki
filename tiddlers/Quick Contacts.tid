''Prerequisites'' [[Connections]] or [[Underworld Connections]].

You know where to go, who to talk to, and how to make new connections, fast. 

Upon entering a new settlement, spending 1 day of downtime allows you to build enough connections to make use of the [[Connections]] or [[Underworld Connections]] feats. 

If youâ€™re legendary in Society, you can form the required connections within 1 hour of entering a new settlement.
