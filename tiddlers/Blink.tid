{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

You blink quickly between the Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane. 

You gain resistance 5 to all damage (except force). 

You can [[Sustain the Spell|Sustain a Spell]] to vanish and reappear 10 feet away in a random direction determined by the GM; the movement doesnâ€™t trigger reactions. 

At the end of your turn, you vanish and reappear as above.

''Heightened (+2)'' The resistance increases by 3.
