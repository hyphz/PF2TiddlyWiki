type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

A weapon with the hampering trait includes a disruptive limb or flange. 

You can use an [[Interact]] action to thrash the weapon in a square within the weaponâ€™s reach. That square becomes [[Difficult Terrain]] until you attack with the weapon, move, would otherwise stop thrashing it, or at the beginning of your next turn.
