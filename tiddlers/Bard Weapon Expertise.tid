type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

You have become thoroughly adept with bardic weapons. 

You gain expert proficiency in simple weapons, plus the [[Longsword]], [[Rapier]], [[Sap]], [[Shortbow]], [[Shortsword]], and [[Whip]].

When you critically succeed at an attack roll using one of these weapons while one of your compositions is active, you apply the [[Critical Specialization Effect]] for that weapon.
