You protect those near you with a flash of steel. 

When youâ€™re benefiting from [[Dueling Parry]], allies adjacent to you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to AC. 

If you have [[Dueling Riposte]], you can use it when an enemy within your reach critically fails a Strike against an ally adjacent to you, not just against yourself.
