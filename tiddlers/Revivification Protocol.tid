''Frequency'' once per day

''Trigger'' You have the [[Dying]] condition and are about to attempt a [[Recovery Check]].

Your nanites are programmed to automatically revive you. 

Youâ€™re restored to 1 Hit Point, lose the [[Dying]] and [[Unconscious]] conditions, and can act normally on this turn. 

You gain or increase the [[Wounded]] condition as normal when losing the dying condition in this way.
