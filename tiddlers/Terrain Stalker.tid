''Prerequisites'' Trained in [[Stealth]].

Select one type of difficult terrain from the following list: rubble, snow, or underbrush. 

While [[Undetected]] by all non-allies in that type of terrain, you can [[Sneak]] without attempting a Stealth check as long as you move no more than 5 feet and do not move within 10 feet of an enemy at any point during your movement. 

This also allows you to automatically approach creatures to within 15 feet while [[Avoiding Notice|Avoid Notice]] during exploration as long as they arenâ€™t actively [[Search]]ing or on guard.

You can select this feat multiple times. Each time, choose a different type of terrain.
