''Trigger'' A creature within range is attacked.

With a flourish, you fulfill a creature’s wish for protection, bending reality to keep them from harm. 

The target vanishes in a burst of brightly colored smoke and sparkles, reappearing an instant later. They become [[Concealed]] against the triggering attack and until the end of the current creature’s turn.
