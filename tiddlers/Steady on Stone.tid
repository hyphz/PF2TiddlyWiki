Your connection to the earth makes natural uneven surfaces less of a hindrance for you. 

You can ignore [[Difficult Terrain]] caused by rubble and uneven ground made of stone and earth. 

In addition, when you use the [[Acrobatics]] skill to [[Balance]] on narrow surfaces or uneven ground made of stone and earth, you arenâ€™t [[Flat-Footed]], and when you roll a success at one of these Acrobatics checks, you get a critical success instead.
