{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

A wave of gray mist formed of negative energy spills out from your outstretched hand, briefly taking the shape of a pack of predatory animals that set viciously on your foes. 

You deal 2d4 slashing damage and 2d4 negative damage to creatures in the area //with a basic [[Fortitude]] save.// 

The shades set upon the vulnerable with greater ferocity: [[Prone]] creatures or those taking persistent bleed damage take a â€“2 status penalty to the save.

''Heightened (+1)'' The slashing damage and the negative damage each increase by 1d4.
