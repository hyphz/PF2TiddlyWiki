{{LOWGFeat}}

Youâ€™ve sworn yourself as a sentry for the Knights of Lastwall, the first line of defense against 
incursions by the Whispering Tyrant throughout Golarion. 

You become trained in [[Athletics]] and in Undead [[Lore]]; if you were already trained, you become an expert instead. 

Finally, you gain the [[Reactive Shield]] fighter feat.
