''Usage'' etched onto armor

The armor allows you to make a controlled descent.

''Activate'' {{OneAction}} <<tag Command>>; ''Effect'' You glide slowly toward the ground, 5 feet down and up to 25 feet forward through the air. Provided you spend at least 1 action gliding on your turn and havenâ€™t yet reached the ground, you remain in the air at the end of your turn. Otherwise, you fall.
