title: Owlbear Egg
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Not only are owlbear eggs delicious when boiled, but when infused with a mix of alchemical reagents, they also make you emit a long screech much like an owlbearâ€™s. 

//When you eat the egg ({{TwoAction}} [[Interact]])//, all creatures in a 30-foot [[Emanation]] must attempt a DC 23 [[Will]] save. 

Regardless of the result, creatures in the area are temporarily immune to this screech for 1 minute.
