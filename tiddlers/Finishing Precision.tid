type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

You’ve learned how to land daring blows when you have [[Panache]]. 

You gain the [[Precise Strike]] class feature, but you deal 1 additional damage on a hit and 1d6 damage on a finisher. This damage doesn’t increase as you gain levels. 

In addition, you gain the [[Basic Finisher]] action.
