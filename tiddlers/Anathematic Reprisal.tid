{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

You punish a creature that transgresses against your deity, drawing upon the anguish you feel upon seeing one of your deityâ€™s anathema committed.

You can cast this spell only when a creature actively commits a unique act of anathema. For example, if creating undead were anathema to your deity, you could use anathematic reprisal on a necromancer who had just created undead in
front of you, but not on an undead creature just for existing.

You deal 4d6 mental damage to the target, but a basic Will save can reduce this damage. If it fails, it is also stupefied 1 for 1 round. 

The creature is then temporarily immune for 1 minute.

''Heightened (+1)'' The damage increases by 1d6.
