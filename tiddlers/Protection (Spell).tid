{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

You ward a creature against a specified alignment. 

Choose <<tag Chaotic>>, <<tag Evil>>, <<tag Good>>, or <<tag Lawful>> when you cast this spell.

The target gains a +1 status bonus to Armor Class and saving throws against creatures and effects of the chosen alignment. 

This bonus increases to +3 against effects from such creatures that would directly control the target and against attacks made by <<tag Summoned>> creatures of the chosen alignment.

This spell gains the trait that opposes the alignment you choseâ€”if you choose chaos, this spell gains the lawful trait, and vice versa; if you choose evil, this spell gains the good trait, and vice versa.
