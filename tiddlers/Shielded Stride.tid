title: Shielded Stride
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

When your shield is up, your enemies’ blows can’t touch you. 

When you have your shield raised, you can [[Stride]] to move half your Speed without triggering reactions that are triggered by your movement (such as [[Attacks of Opportunity|Attack of Opportunity]]). 

You can use Shielded Stride while Flying or Swimming instead of Striding if you have the corresponding movement type.
