type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Your muse is a virtuoso, inspiring you to greater heights. If itâ€™s a creature, it might be a performance-loving creature such as a choral angel or lillend azata; if a deity, it might be //a god of music//. As a bard with a maestro muse, you are an inspiration to your allies and confident of your musical and oratorical abilities. 

You gain the [[Lingering Composition]] feat and add [[Soothe]] to your spell repertoire.
