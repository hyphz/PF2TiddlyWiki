You can deliver silent messages. 

You gain touch telepathy, allowing you to communicate silently and mentally with any creature youâ€™re touching, as long as you share a language.

''[[Enhancement]]'' You can send your messages even further. Your telepathy gains a range of 10 feet, but you still have to share a language with your target.
