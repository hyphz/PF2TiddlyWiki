''Prerequisite'' Master in [[Crafting]].

You can sharpen weapons, polish armor, and apply special techniques to temporarily gain better effects from your armaments. 

By spending 1 hour working on a weapon or armor, you can grant it the effects of a +1 potency rune until your next daily preparations, gaining a +1 item bonus to attack rolls for a weapon or increasing armorâ€™s item bonus to AC by 1. 

This has no effect if the weapon or armor already had a potency rune.
