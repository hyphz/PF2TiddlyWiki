Your ancestors crossed the Crown of the World or resided on snowy peaks. You gain cold resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1). You treat [[environmental cold effects|Temperature Effects]] as if they were one step less extreme (incredible cold becomes extreme, extreme cold becomes severe, and so on). Your alternate form is a common Medium humanoid ancestry prevalent where you grew up (typically human), called a tailless form.
