{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

You add a flourish to your composition to extend its benefits.

If your next action is to cast a cantrip composition with a duration of 1 round, attempt a [[Performance]] check. 

The DC is usually a standard-difficulty DC of a level equal to the highestâ€‘level target of your composition, but the GM can assign a different DC based on the circumstances. 

The effect depends on the result of your check.
