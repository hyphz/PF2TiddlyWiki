{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

All creatures in the area when you cast the spell are limned in colorful, heatless fire of a color of your choice for the duration. 

Visible creatures canâ€™t be [[Concealed]] while affected by faerie fire. 

If the creatures are [[Invisible]], they are [[Concealed]] while affected by faerie fire, rather than being [[Undetected]].
