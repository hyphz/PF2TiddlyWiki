Devil horns grow from your skull, and your skin takes on features of the devil responsible for your diabolic bloodline.

You gain resistance 5 to <<tag Evil>>, <<tag Fire>>, and <<tag Poison>>, and resistance 1 to physical damage (except silver). 

You can take <<tag Good>> damage, even if you arenâ€™t evil, and you gain weakness 5 to good damage.

''Heightened (+2)'' The resistance to evil, fire, and poison increases by 5, the resistance to physical damage (except silver) by 2, and the weakness to good damage by 5.
