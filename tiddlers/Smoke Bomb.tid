''Frequency'' Once per round.

''Additive 1''.

''Trigger'' You use [[Quick Alchemy]] to craft an alchemical bomb with a level at least 1 lower than your advanced alchemy level.

You cause the bomb to create a cloud of thick smoke, in addition to its normal effects. 

When thrown, the bomb creates a cloud of smoke in a 10-foot-radius burst. You choose which corner of the targetâ€™s space (or the space in which the bomb lands) the cloud is centered on. 

Creatures within that area have the [[Concealed]] condition, and all other creatures are concealed to them. 

The smoke lasts for 1 minute or until dissipated by a strong wind.
