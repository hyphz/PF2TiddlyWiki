With a minor adjustment of ratios in the formula for your serene mutagen, you gain mental protections. 

When youâ€™re affected by a [[Serene Mutagen]] you created, <<tag Detection>>, <<tag Revelation>>, and <<tag Scrying>>effects of 9th level or lower detect nothing from you or your possessions and auras. For instance, [[Detect Magic]] would still detect other magic in the area, but not any magic on you.
