Long-lived elves have seen civilizations rise and fall, often at the hands of outside forces. As a result, they have developed a wariness of others who might seek to influence or control them. 

Youâ€™ve been trained to resist such manipulation, gaining a +2 circumstance bonus to saving throws against effects that would make you [[Controlled]], such as [[Dominate]], and to [[Perception]] checks to [[Sense Motive]] when trying to determine if a creature is under the influence of such an effect. 

When you roll a success on a saving throw against such an effect, you get a critical success instead.
