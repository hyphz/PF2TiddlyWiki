A creature with darkvision can see perfectly well in areas of darkness and dim light, though such vision is in black and white only. 

Some forms of magical darkness, such as a 4th-level [[Darkness]] spell, block normal darkvision. 

A creature with [[Greater Darkvision]], however, can see through even these forms of magical darkness.
