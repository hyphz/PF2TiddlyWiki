title: Magic Sense
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

You have a literal sixth sense for ambient magic in your vicinity.

You can sense the presence of magic auras as though you were always using a 1st-level [[Detect Magic]] spell. This detects magic in your field of vision only. 

When you [[Seek]], you gain the benefits of a 3rd-level detect magic spell on things you see (in addition to the normal benefits of Seeking). 

You can turn this sense off and on with a free action at the start or the end of your turn.
