title: Entrancing Eyes
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

Your eyes glow with an entrancing radiance that captivates those who meet your gaze. 

Any creature that ends its turn within the emanation must attempt a [[Will]] save.

{{||SaveSuccessTable}}

During any round you Sustain the Spell, you can use a single action, which has the <<tag Manipulate>> trait, to focus your entrancing eyes on a single creature you can see within 30 feet. This creature must immediately make a Will save against the spell as if it were ending its turn in the emanation. 

If the creature was already fascinated by your entrancing eyes before its save, a failed save causes it to be [[Paralyzed]] for 1 round. You canâ€™t use this action to focus on the same creature more than once per round.
