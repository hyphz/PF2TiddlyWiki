Your eidolon gains an evolution integral to its form, and it comes more easily than your other synergies. 

You gain one evolution feat from the following list: [[Airborne Form]], [[Burrowing Form]], [[Ever-Vigilant Senses]], or [[Hulking Size]]. 

For the purpose of meeting its prerequisites, your summoner level is equal to your character level â€“ 4.
