''Prerequisites'' ability to cast [[Heal]] and [[Harm]]

Your connection to both life and undeath lets you twist the healing power of magic items to suit your own needs and aims. 

Whenever you Activate an Item to cast a [[Heal]] spell, you can invert its energy to produce the effects of an equivalent [[Harm]] spell instead.
