title: Disrupt Prey
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

''Trigger'' Your hunted prey is within your reach, and it uses a <<tag Manipulate>> action, uses a <<tag Move>> action, or leaves a square during a move action itâ€™s using.

Make a melee [[Strike]] against your prey. 

If the attack is a critical hit, you disrupt the triggering action.
