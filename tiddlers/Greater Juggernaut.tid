You have a stalwart physiology. 

Your proficiency rank for [[Fortitude]] saves increases to legendary. 

When you roll a critical failure on a Fortitude save, you get a failure instead. 

When you __roll a failure on__ a Fortitude save against an effect that deals damage, you halve the damage you take.
