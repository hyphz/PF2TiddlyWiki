''Prerequisites'' Trained in [[Religion]].

Youâ€™ve researched many faiths enough to recognize notions about them that are unlikely to be true. 

If you roll a critical failure at a Religion check to [[Decipher Writing]] of a religious nature or to Recall Knowledge about the tenets of faiths, you get a failure instead. 

When attempting to [[Recall Knowledge]] about the tenets of your own faith, if you roll a failure, you get a success instead, and if you roll a success, you get a critical success instead.
