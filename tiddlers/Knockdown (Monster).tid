title: Knockdown (Monster)
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

''Requirements'' The monsterâ€™s last action was a success with a [[Strike]] that lists Knockdown in its damage entry.

The monster __attempts to [[Trip]] the creature. This attempt neither applies nor counts towards the monster's multiple attack penalty.__

//Knockdown is a monster ability. The more normal equivalent ability for PCs is [[Trip]].//

//Remaster: altered to use the Trip rules instead of automatically knocking Prone.//
