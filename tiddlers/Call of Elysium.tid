type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The wild wonder of Elysium harmonizes within you, and in dire straits, you can share its benefits with your allies. 

Your Speed increases by 5 feet; the Speed increase from this feat isnâ€™t cumulative with any Speed increase from your ancestry feats (such as [[Nimble Elf]]). 

Allies who begin their turn in combat adjacent to you gain a +5-foot status bonus to their Speed for the round.
