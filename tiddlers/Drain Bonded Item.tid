''Frequency'' once per day. //If you are a universalist wizard, you can use Drain Bonded Item once per day to recall a spell of each level you can cast. If you are a specialist, you can only use it once per day in total.//

You expend the power stored in your bonded item. 

During your turn, you gain the ability to cast one spell you prepared today and already cast, without spending a spell slot. 

You must still [[Cast the Spell|Cast a Spell]] and meet the spellâ€™s other requirements.

//The requirement to do this when your turn begins was removed by errata.//
