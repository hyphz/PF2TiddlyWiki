Your remarkable breath control and concise instructions allow you to coordinate your allies more effectively. 

When you grant allies the quickened condition using [[Cadence Call]], they can use the extra action to either [[Stride]] or [[Strike]], and they arenâ€™t [[Slowed]] 1 on their following turn if they use the extra action.
