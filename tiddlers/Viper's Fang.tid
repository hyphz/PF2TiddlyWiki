Affix to a weapon.

''Requirements'' You are a master with the affixed weapon.

''Trigger'' A creature within your reach uses a <<tag Manipulate>> or <<tag Move>> action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using.

When you activate {{ReactionIcon}} this resin-strengthened viper skull, you make an [[Attack of Opportunity]] against the triggering creature.

If you have Attack of Opportunity, you can activate the viperâ€™s fang as a free action.
