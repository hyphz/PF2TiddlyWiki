You fire a ray of burning sunlight from your weapon. You must be wielding a sword or spear to cast sun blade, and you perform this spellâ€™s somatic component with the weapon. 

Make a spell attack roll. The spell deals double damage on a critical hit. __The spell does not deal damage on a miss.__

The ray deals 1d4 fire damage. If the target is evil, the ray deals an additional 1d4 good damage, and if the target is undead, the ray deals an additional 1d4 positive damage (both effects apply against creatures that are both evil and undead). 

If you are in an area of bright natural sunlight, increase the die size of each damage die by one step (from d4 to d6).

''Heightened (+1)'' The damage increases by 1d4 fire, 1d4 good, and 1d4 positive (or 1d6 of each type of damage in bright natural sunlight).
