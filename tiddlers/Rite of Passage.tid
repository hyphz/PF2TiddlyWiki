Your exoskeleton remains connected with the plants that created it. 

You can ignore [[Difficult Terrain]] and [[Uneven Ground]] caused by undergrowth. 

In addition, when you use the [[Acrobatics]] skill to [[Balance]] on narrow surfaces or uneven ground within forests, you arenâ€™t flat-footed. 

When you roll a success attempting one of these Acrobatics checks, you get a critical success instead.
