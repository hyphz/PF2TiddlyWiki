{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

Your eidolon releases a powerful energy attack that deals 5d6 damage of the type you chose when you took the Eidolonâ€™s Wrath feat, with a basic [[Reflex]] save.

You determine the damage type when you gain the feat: acid, cold, electricity, fire, negative, positive, or sonic. If your eidolon is a celestial, fiend, or monitor with an alignment other than true neutral, you can choose a damage type in its alignment. 

''Heightened (+1)'' The damage increases by 2d6.
