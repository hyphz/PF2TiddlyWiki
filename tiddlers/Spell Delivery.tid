If your familiar is in your space, you can [[Cast a Spell]] with a range of touch, transfer its power to your familiar, and command the familiar to deliver the spell. 

If you do, the familiar uses its 2 actions for the round to move to a target of your choice and touch that target. 

If it doesnâ€™t reach the target to touch it this turn, the spell has no effect.
