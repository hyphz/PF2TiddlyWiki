All communication is filled with slight tells and signals. 

If you interact with someone for at least 10 minutes, their regional words, pronunciation changes, and nonverbal cues provide you with a minor fact about their social environment, such as their hometown or certain groups they might belong to. 

If a target of this ability is being deceptive about their social environment, such as a commoner pretending to be a noble, they must attempt a [[Deception]], [[Society]], or appropriate [[Lore]] check against your Society DC, providing you a false minor fact consistent with their assumed identity on a success.

Once youâ€™ve gleaned one or more true minor facts about a person, you can then incorporate these mannerisms into your speech to present yourself in a way that they find familiar. This grants you a +1 circumstance bonus to your [[Diplomacy]] and [[Deception]] checks with them.
