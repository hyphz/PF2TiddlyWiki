''Trigger'' You take damage from an area effect that allows a [[Reflex]] save.

You dodge a blow at the last possible moment. 

You [[Step]] and gain resistance to all damage equal to your level against the triggering effect. 

If your Step moves you out of the triggering effectâ€™s area, this resistance is instead equal to your level plus your [[Dexterity]] modifier.
