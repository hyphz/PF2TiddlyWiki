You strain yourself to move at double your travel speed. 

You can Hustle only for a number of minutes equal to your [[Constitution]] modifier * 10 (minimum 10 minutes). 

If you are in a group that is Hustling, use the lowest Constitution modifier among everyone to determine how fast the group can Hustle together.
