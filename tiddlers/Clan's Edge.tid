''Prerequisites'' Trained in Clan Daggers.

By moving your clan dagger with rapid precision, you can protect yourself more effectively. 

Make two clan dagger [[Strike]]s against different targets. Your [[Multiple Attack Penalty]] applies normally to these Strikes. You then use an [[Interact]] action to gain the +1 circumstance bonus to your AC from your clan daggerâ€™s [[Parry]]ing trait.
