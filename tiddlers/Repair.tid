''Requirements'' You have a [[Repair Kit]].

You spend 10 minutes attempting to fix a damaged item, placing the item on a stable surface and using the repair kit with both hands. //If you have [[Quick Repair]], it takes less time depending on your proficiency in Crafting.//

//Make a [[Crafting]] check.// The GM sets the DC, but it’s usually about the same DC to Repair a given item as it is to [[Craft]] it in the first place. 

You can’t Repair a destroyed item.
