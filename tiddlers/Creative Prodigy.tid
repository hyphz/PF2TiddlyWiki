You have a powerful creative drive, useful for prevarication and performance. 

You gain the trained proficiency rank in [[Deception]] and [[Performance]]. If you are already trained in either of these skills, you become trained in a skill of your choice in its place. 

You also become trained in Art [[Lore]].
