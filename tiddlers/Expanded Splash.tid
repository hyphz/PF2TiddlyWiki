''Prerequisite'' [[Calculated Splash]].

The particularly volatile compounds that you brew into your bombs result in them creating especially large and powerful explosions. 

When you throw an alchemical bomb and that bomb has the <<tag Splash>> trait, you can add your Intelligence modifier to the bombâ€™s usual splash damage, and it deals splash damage to every creature within 10 feet of the target.
