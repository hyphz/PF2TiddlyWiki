''Prerequisites'' [[Strength]] 14.

With additional care and effort, you can take on an alternate form for a longer period of time. 

If your next action is to cast [[Wild Shape]], wild shapeâ€™s spell level is 2 lower than normal (minimum 1st level), but you can remain transformed for up to 1 hour or the listed duration (whichever is longer). 

You can still [[Dismiss]] the form at any time, as permitted by the spell.
