You can put more effort into your [[Kobold Breath]] to channel greater draconic power, though it takes more out of you. 

When you use Kobold Breath, you can increase the damage dice to d8s and increase the area to 60 feet for a [[Line]] breath weapon or 30 feet for a [[Cone]]. 

If you do, you canâ€™t use Kobold Breath again for 1 hour.
