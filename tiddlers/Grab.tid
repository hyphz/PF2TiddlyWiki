''Requirements'' The monsterâ€™s last action was a success with a [[Strike]] that lists Grab in its damage entry, or it has a creature [[Grabbed]] __or [[Restrained]]__.

__If used after a Strike, the monster attempts to [[Grapple]] the creature using the body part it attacked with. This attempt neither applies nor counts towards the creature's multiple attack penalty.__

__The monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that duration to the end of the monster's next turn.__

//Grab is a monster ability. The more normal equivalent ability for PCs is [[Grapple]].//

//Remaster: changed to use [[Grapple]] instead of automatically granting Grabbed status. Re-using Grab extends the duration for one grabbed creature, not all of them.//
