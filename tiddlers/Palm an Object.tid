title: Palm an Object
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Palming a small, unattended object without being noticed requires you to roll a single [[Thievery]] check against the [[Perception]] DCs of all creatures who are currently observing
you. 

You take the object whether or not you successfully conceal that you did so. 

You can typically only Palm Objects of negligible Bulk, though the GM might determine otherwise depending on the situation.
