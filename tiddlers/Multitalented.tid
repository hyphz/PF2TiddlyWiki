You’ve learned to split your focus between multiple classes with ease. 

You gain a 2nd-level multiclass dedication feat, even if you normally couldn’t take another dedication feat until you take more feats from your current archetype.

If you’re a [[Half-Elf]], you don’t need to meet the feat’s ability score prerequisites.
