{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

A flowing cloak of utter darkness drapes over you, filled with pinpricks of light like distant stars. 

It imparts the stillness of the cosmos to you, granting you a +2 status bonus to [[Stealth]] checks to [[Hide]] and [[Sneak]]. 

While outside under a starry night sky, youâ€™re also [[Invisible]] as long as you remain still. When
moving under a starry night sky, you are [[Concealed]] instead.

Gazing too closely into the stars is disorienting. Any creature that ends its turn adjacent to you must attempt a [[Will]] save; this is a <<tag Mental>><<tag Visual>> effect.
