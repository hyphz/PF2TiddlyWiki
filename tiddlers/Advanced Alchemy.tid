During your [[daily preparations|Rest]], after producing new infused reagents, you can spend batches of those infused reagents to create infused alchemical items. 

You don’t need to attempt a [[Crafting]] check to do this, and you ignore both the number of days typically required to create the items and any alchemical reagent requirements.

Your advanced alchemy level is equal to your level //if you are an [[Alchemist]]. If you have [[Alchemist Dedication]], it is equal to 1 unless you have the feats [[Expert Alchemy]] and/or [[Master Alchemy]] to increase it.//

For each batch of infused reagents you spend, choose an alchemical item of your advanced alchemy level or lower that’s in your formula book, and make a batch of two of that item. 

These items have the <<tag Infused>> trait and remain potent for 24 hours or until your next daily preparations, whichever comes first.
