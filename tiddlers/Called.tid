You have heard the Call, and in constantly resisting that persistent demand, youâ€™ve developed a mental bulwark against effects that would target your mind. 

You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [[Will]] saving throws against <<tag Mental>> effects. If you roll a success on your saving throw against a mental effect that would make you [[Controlled]], you get a critical success instead.
