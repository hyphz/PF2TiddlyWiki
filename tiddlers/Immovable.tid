This rune utilizes magical principles used in an [[Immovable Rod]].

''Activate'' {{OneAction}} [[Interact]]; ''Frequency'' once per day; ''Effect'' Your armor anchors you in place, even defying gravity, rendering you [[Immobilized]] until you Dismiss the Activation. While youâ€™re immobilized in this way, you can be moved only if a creature succeeds at a DC 40 [[Athletics]] check to [[Force Open]] your armor. You can also be moved if 8,000 pounds of pressure are placed upon you, though this is likely fatal.
