{{LOWGFeat}}

Youâ€™ve learned how to move as one with crowds and hide among them, vanishing into a busy street in the blink of an eye. 

You move at full Speed in crowds and can use cover from crowds to [[Hide]] and [[Sneak]], gaining a +2 circumstance bonus on your [[Stealth]] checks when in a crowd of at least 10 creatures and a +4 circumstance bonus on your [[Stealth]] checks when in a crowd of at least 100 creatures.
