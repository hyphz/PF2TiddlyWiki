You’ve learned how to handle situations when you’re out of your depth. 

Your proficiency bonus to untrained skill checks is equal to half your level instead of +0. 

If you’re 7th level or higher, the bonus increases to your full level instead. 

This doesn’t allow you to use the skill’s trained actions.
