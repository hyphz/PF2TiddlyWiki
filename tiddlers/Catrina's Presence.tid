title: Catrina's Presence
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Youâ€™ve adopted the calming presence of catrinas, the festive dead; you might have even danced with a catrina yourself! 

So long as you are visibly carrying fresh flowers or colorful ribbons somewhere on your person, you can cast [[Calm]] twice per day as a 2nd-level divine innate spell.
