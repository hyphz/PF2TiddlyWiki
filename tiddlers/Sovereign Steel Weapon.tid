title: Sovereign Steel Weapon
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Sovereign steel weapons are treated as cold iron against creatures with a weakness to
cold iron, like demons and fey. 

In addition, the noqual in sovereign steel weapons disrupts spellcastersâ€™ concentration, causing them to become [[Stupefied]] 1 for 1 round on a critical hit.
