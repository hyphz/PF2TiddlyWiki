You are attuned to the minute sounds and sensations of restless spirits. 

Even if you arenâ€™t [[Search]]ing, you can attempt a check to find haunts that normally require you to be Searching. 

//[[Search]] is an exploration activity, and is not the same as [[Seek]].//

You still need to meet any other requirements to find the haunt.
