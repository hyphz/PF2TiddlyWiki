You can hang by your tail from any suitable anchor point, such as a tree branch, balcony, or rocky outcropping (subject to the GMâ€™s discretion), typically while climbing.  

While hanging, you have free use of all your other limbs, so you can perform tasks that require both hands, such as firing a bow or swinging a greatsword.
