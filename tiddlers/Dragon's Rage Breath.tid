''Prerequisites'' [[Dragon Instinct]].

''Requirements'' You havenâ€™t used this ability since you last Raged.

You breathe deeply and exhale powerful energy in a 30-foot [[Cone]] or 60-foot [[Line]], dealing 1d6 damage per level. 

The area and damage type match those of your dragon. 

If you used this ability in the last hour, the area and the damage are halved (15-foot cone or 30-foot line; 1d6 damage for every 2 levels).

Each creature in the area must attempt a basic [[Reflex]] save.
