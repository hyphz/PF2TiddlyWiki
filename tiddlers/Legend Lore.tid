a-crit: You recite legends, tales, and lore about the subject over the course of an hour after the ritual ends. The information is mostly coherent, emphasizing more accurate or useful legends over those exaggerated over time.
a-defense: 
a-fail: You fail to learn any useful legends.
a-fumble: Your mind becomes lost in the past. You canâ€™t sense or respond to anything in the present for 1 week except to perform necessities like breathing and sleeping. When you return, however, you can retrain one of your skills into a [[Lore]] based on the knowledge of the past you were uncontrollably viewing, as if you had spent 1 week retraining.
a-hit: You recite mysterious legends, tales, and lore about the subject over the course of an hour after the ritual ends. These provide useful information for further inquiry but are generally incomplete or enigmatic. As is the nature of legends, you are likely to learn multiple contradictory versions.
