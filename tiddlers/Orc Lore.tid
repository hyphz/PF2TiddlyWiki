The hold elders taught you your peopleâ€™s histories, told tales of great athletic feats, and shared with you the hardships your ancestors endured so that you can pass this wisdom down to future generations. 

You become trained in [[Athletics]] and [[Survival]]. If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. 

You also become trained in Orc [[Lore]].
