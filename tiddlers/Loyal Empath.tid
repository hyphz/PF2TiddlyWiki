You have incredible empathy for your friends and family, and you have an innate timing for helping others in distress.

You can use the [[Aid]] reaction to grant a bonus to another creatureâ€™s [[Will]] saving throw. 

As usual for Aid, you need to prepare by using an action on your turn to encourage the creature to bravely withstand the effect.
