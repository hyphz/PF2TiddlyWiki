Snares you create have complicated inner workings that are quite difficult to disable. 

Creatures attempting to [[Disable|Disable a Device]] your snares that use gears must succeed at an additional [[Thievery]] check in order to disable the snare. 

On a failed check, while the snare doesnâ€™t fully trigger, the grinding mechanisms deal bludgeoning damage to the creature equal to half your level. 

The snare still triggers on a critical failure, as normal.
