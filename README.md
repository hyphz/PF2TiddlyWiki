# PF2TiddlyWiki
TiddlyWiki based reference to Pathfinder 2e OGL material.

The objective of this repository is to build a PF2 reference, similar to the Archives of Nethys, within TiddlyWiki.

This has the benefit of being accessible locally and quickly in multiple compatible formats, and having high levels of support for semantic and intelligent searches, 
and clarification of rules as well as official material.

It can be used in one of three ways:

1. Install TiddlyWiki itself from npm (`npm -g install tiddlywiki`) then run it in the top directory. This will host the TiddlyWiki locally and is needed to be able to edit it.
2. Open `output/index.html` in a web browser. This stores the entire reference in one file. This can be saved on your mobile device, copied around, etc., and freely used as a single file reference for all topics in the system. You can also import this into TiddlyWiki hosts such as _TiddlyDesktop_ and _Quine_. If you don't import it into another tool, you can view everything but not save any edits you make.
3. Open the HTML files in `output/static`. These are the individual references, but this method does not allow search or other more sophisticated features.
