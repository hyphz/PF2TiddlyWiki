Youâ€™ve continued to expand your compendium of tools to compile knowledge. 

You can cast [[Comprehend Language]], [[Mindlink]], and [[Secret Page]] as innate occult spells, each once per day. 

When you cast secret page, it is automatically heightened to the same spell level as your cantrips from Magical Edification.
