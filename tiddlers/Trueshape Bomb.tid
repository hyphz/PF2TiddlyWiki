title: Trueshape Bomb
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Concentrated wolfsbane and other anti-shapechanger reagents fill trueshape bombs. 

These bombs grant an item bonus to attack rolls and deal poison damage, persistent poison damage, and poison splash damage, according to their type. 

If the primary target is under the effects of a <<tag Morph>> or <<tag Polymorph>> effect, it must succeed at a [[Fortitude]] saving throw at the bombâ€™s listed DC, or else the effects end and the creature returns to its normal form. 

Targets taking persistent poison damage from this bomb must succeed at another [[Fortitude]] saving throw at the same DC to change shape using a <<tag Morph>> or <<tag Polymorph>> effect.

The persistent damage can last up to 1 minute.
