As a pirate, you sail the seas in search of enemy ships to plunder. 

You become trained in Sailing [[Lore]], or become an expert in it if you were already trained. 

You ignore the effects of [[Difficult Terrain]] or [[Uneven Ground]] caused by a shipâ€™s movement. 

Additionally, you gain the [[Boarding Assault]] action.
