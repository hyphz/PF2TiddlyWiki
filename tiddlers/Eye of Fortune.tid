Adherents of //the// god of the hunt create these magical eye patches. 

An eye of fortune has a jeweled eye symbol on its front, allowing you to magically see through the eye patch as though it were transparent.

''Activate'' {{FreeAction}} envision (fortune); ''Trigger'' You attack a [[Concealed]] or [[Hidden]] creature and havenâ€™t attempted the flat check yet; ''Effect'' You can roll the flat check for the concealed or hidden condition twice and use the higher result.
