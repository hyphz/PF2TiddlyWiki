''Trigger'' You would take damage from an attack, spell, or other effect.

Your supernatural connection sometimes causes you to phase from reality when under threat, disappearing for split seconds before reappearingâ€”often surprising you as much as your enemies. 

Roll a DC 16 flat check. On a success, you gain resistance to all damage equal to your level against the triggering effect, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saving throws against that effect until the start of your turn, and you gain the [[Dazzled]] condition for 1 round.
