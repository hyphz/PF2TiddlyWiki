While wearing this silver religious symbol, you can cast the [[Disrupt Undead]] cantrip as an innate divine spell.

''Activate'' {{ThreeAction}} command, Interact; ''Frequency'' once per day; ''Effect'' By touching a weapon you wield to the symbol and uttering a plea, you grant that weapon the [[Deadly]] d12 trait. Against undead, the weapon instead gains the [[Fatal]] d12 trait. This blessing lasts for 1 minute, until you score a critical hit with the weapon, or until you arenâ€™t wielding the weapon.
