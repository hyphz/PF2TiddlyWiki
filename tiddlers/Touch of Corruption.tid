{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

You infuse the target with negative energy. 

If the target is living, this deals 1d6 negative damage (basic [[Fortitude]] save); on a failed save, the target also takes a â€“2 status penalty to AC for 1 round.

If the target is a willing undead creature, the target instead regains 6 Hit Points, and if you are the undead target, you also gain a +2 status bonus to damage rolls for 1 round.

''Heightened (+1)'' Increase the damage dealt to a living creature by 1d6 or increase the Hit Points regained by undead by 6.
