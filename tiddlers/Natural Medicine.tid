''Prerequisites'' Trained in [[Nature]].

You can apply natural cures to heal your allies. You can use Nature instead of [[Medicine]] to [[Treat Wounds]]. 

If you’re in the wilderness, you might have easier access to fresh ingredients, allowing you to gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your check to Treat Wounds using Nature, subject to the GM’s determination.
