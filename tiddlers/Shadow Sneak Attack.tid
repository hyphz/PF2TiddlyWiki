title: Shadow Sneak Attack
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

You gain the [[Sneak Attack]] class feature, except you deal 1d6 precision damage regardless of your level.

Sneak attack from multiple sources isnâ€™t cumulative. 

If you have sneak attack from more than one source, use only the highest number of dice when you sneak attack rather than adding the amounts together.
