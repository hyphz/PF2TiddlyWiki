turn-eun: Resistance wears off.
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

When you cast energy spells, you retain some of that energy as a protective barrier. 

If your next action is to Cast a Spell that deals energy damage, whether or not it successfully deals damage, you gain resistance to that type of energy equal to the spellâ€™s level (minimum 1) until the end of your next turn. 

If the spell deals more than one type of energy damage, choose one and gain resistance to that type.
