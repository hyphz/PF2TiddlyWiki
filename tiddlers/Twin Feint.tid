''Requirements'' You are wielding two melee weapons, each in a different hand.

You make a dazzling series of attacks with both weapons, using the first attack to throw your foe off guard against a second attack at a different angle. 

Make one [[Strike]] with each of your two melee weapons, both against the same target. 

The target is automatically [[Flatâ€‘Footed]] against the second attack. 

Apply your multiple attack penalty to the Strikes normally.
