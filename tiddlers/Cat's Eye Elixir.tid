After you consume this elixir, your vision sharpens and you become sensitive to even the most minute movements. 

For the next minute, you reduce the flat check to target [[Hidden]] creatures to 5, and you donâ€™t need to attempt a flat check to target [[Concealed]] creatures. 

These benefits apply only against creatures within 30 feet of you.
