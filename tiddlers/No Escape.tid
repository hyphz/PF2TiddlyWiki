''Trigger'' A foe within reach attempts to move away from you.

You keep pace with a retreating foe. 

[[Stride]] up to your Speed, following the foe and keeping it in reach throughout its movement until it stops moving or youâ€™ve moved your full Speed. 

You can use No Escape to [[Burrow]], [[Climb]], [[Fly]], or [[Swim]] instead of Stride if you have the corresponding movement type.
