''Trigger'' A creature attempts a flat check to target you because you’re [[Concealed]] or [[Hidden]] due to fog, haze, mist, or smoke;

You shroud yourself in mist, making it harder for your foe to hit you. 

If you’re concealed, the DC of the flat check increases from 5 to 7; if you’re hidden, it increases from 11 to 13.
