{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

You request a direct intercession from the natural world.

Nature always refuses unnatural requests and might grant a different request (potentially more powerful or better fitting its character) than the one you asked for. 

A primal phenomenon spell can do any of the following things.

* Duplicate any __spell from the primal list__ of 9th level or lower __which you have access to__.
* Duplicate any __spell from another spell list__ of 7th level or lower __is common, or which you have access to__.
* Produce any effect whose power level is in line with the above effects.
* Reverse certain effects that refer to the [[Wish]] spell.

At the GMâ€™s discretion, you can try to use primal phenomenon to produce greater effects than these, but doing so may be dangerous, or the spell may have only a partial effect.
