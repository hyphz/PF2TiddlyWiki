Your shots zip around corners and fly at impossible angles to reach your target. 

Make a bow [[Strike]] against a foe you can see; the ammunition travels to your target, even around corners. //(Although you can't actually shoot a foe who's all the way around a corner because you can't see them.)//

You ignore the targetâ€™s [[Concealed]] condition and all cover.
