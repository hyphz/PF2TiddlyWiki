Afflictions with the virulent trait are harder to remove. You must succeed at two consecutive saves to reduce a virulent affliction’s stage by 1. //These saves are made over the course of two intervals, not both at once.// A critical success reduces a virulent affliction’s stage by only 1 instead of by 2.

If the affliction’s stage is ever reduced below stage 1, the affliction ends and you don’t need to attempt further saves unless you’re exposed to the affliction again.
