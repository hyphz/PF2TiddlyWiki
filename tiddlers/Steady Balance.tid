title: Steady Balance
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

''Prerequisites'' Trained in [[Acrobatics]].

You can keep your balance easily, even in adverse conditions.

Whenever you roll a success using the [[Balance]] action, you get a critical success instead. 

Youâ€™re not [[Flat-Footed]] while attempting to Balance on narrow surfaces and uneven ground. 

Thanks to your incredible balance, you can attempt an Acrobatics check instead of a Reflex save to [[Grab an Edge]].
