You can move through gloom with the speed of darkness. 

You can move 5 feet farther when you take the [[Sneak]] action, up to your Speed. 

In addition, as long as you continue to use Sneak actions and succeed at your [[Stealth]] check, you donâ€™t become [[Observed]] if you end a Sneak action in dim light or darkness, as long as you have cover or greater cover or are concealed at the end of your turn.
