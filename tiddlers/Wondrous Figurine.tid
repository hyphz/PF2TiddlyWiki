title: Wondrous Figurine
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Each one of these statuettes is 1 inch in height, carved from a specific material and taking the shape of a particular animal or animals.

''Activate'' {{TwoAction}} command, [[Interact]]; ''Effect'' You activate the statue by placing it on solid ground and then speaking its name, causing the statuette to transform into a living creature or creatures. 

In creature form, the figurine has the <<tag Minion>> trait. 

It can understand your language and it obeys you to the best of its ability when you use an action to [[Command]] it. 

The specifics of each creature, as well as the activationâ€™s frequency (if any), appear in its entry below.

If the figurine is slain while in animal form, it reverts to its statue shape and cannot be activated again until 1 week has passed. 

If the figurine is destroyed in statue form, it is shattered and its magic is lost.
