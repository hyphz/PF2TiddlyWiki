{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

''Trigger'' You are about to attempt a [[Will]] save.

Your ancestor protects you against those who would bend your will. 

You roll the triggering save twice and use the better result. 

If youâ€™re in an encounter when you cast this spell, you immediately roll to change your predominant ancestor.
