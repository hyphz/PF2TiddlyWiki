''Requirements'' You are wielding a melee weapon in two hands.

You attack all nearby adversaries. 

Make a melee [[Strike]] with the required weapon against each enemy within your melee reach. 

Each attack counts toward your [[Multiple Attack Penalty]], but donâ€™t increase your penalty until you have made all your attacks.
