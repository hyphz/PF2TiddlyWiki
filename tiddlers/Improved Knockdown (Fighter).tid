type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

You can dash your foe to the ground with a single blow. 

When you use [[Knockdown (Fighter)]], instead of making a [[Strike]] followed by a [[Trip]], you can attempt a single Strike. 

If you do and your Strike hits, you also apply the critical success effect of a Trip. If you used a two-handed melee weapon for the Strike, you can use the weaponâ€™s damage die size instead of the regular die size for the damage from a critical Trip.
