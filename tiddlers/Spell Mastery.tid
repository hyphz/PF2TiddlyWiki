You have mastered a handful of spells to such a degree that you can cast them even if you havenâ€™t prepared them. 

Select any four spells of 9th level or lower that you have access to. Each spell you select must be of a different level. 

These spells are automatically prepared when you make your daily preparations and have their own spell slots. 

You can select a different array of spells by spending 1 week of downtime retraining your mastered spells.
