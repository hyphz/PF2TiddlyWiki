//Implied by [[Bottle the Storm]].//

If you successfully prevent damage in this way, at any time during the spellâ€™s duration, you can spend a single action, which has the Attack trait, to expend the charge and make a melee spell attack at an adjacent target or a ranged spell attack at a target within 60 feet.

This attack deals electricity damage equal to the damage prevented by bottle the storm.
