{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

Memories of a past life that seem incredibly real (and may even be) overwhelm the targetâ€™s mind. 

//They must make a [[Will]] save.//

This is especially disorienting for undead and creatures that have lived a previous life (such as celestials, fiends, monitors, and many other extraplanar creatures); if such creatures roll a critical success on their save, they get a success instead, and if they roll a failure, they get a critical failure instead.
