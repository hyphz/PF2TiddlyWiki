title: Symphony of the Muse
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

You are able to weave countless performances together into a solo symphony. 

You are no longer limited to a single composition each turn or a single composition at a time; when you use a new composition, all previous compositionsâ€™ effects continue for their remaining duration.
