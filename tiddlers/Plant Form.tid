{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

Taking inspiration from verdant creatures, you transform into a Large plant battle form. 

You must have space to expand into or the spell is lost. 

When you cast this spell, choose arboreal, flytrap, or shambler. You can substitute a similar specific plant to turn into (such as a pitcher plant instead of a flytrap), but this has no effect on the form’s Size or statistics. 

While in this form, you gain the <<tag Plant>>trait. 

You can [[Dismiss]] the spell.

{{BattleFormRestrictions}}

You gain the following statistics and abilities regardless of which battle form you choose:

* AC = 19 + your level. Ignore your armor’s check penalty and Speed reduction.
* 12 temporary Hit Points.
* Resistance 10 to poison.
* [[Low-Light Vision]].
* One or more unarmed melee attacks specific to the battle form you choose, which are the only attacks you can __Strike with__. You’re trained with them. Your attack modifier is +17, and your damage bonus is +11. These attacks are [[Strength]] based (for the purpose of the [[Enfeebled]] condition, for example). If your unarmed attack modifier is higher, you can use it instead.
* [[Athletics]] modifier of +19, unless your own modifier is higher.

You also gain specific abilities based on the type of plant you choose:

* ''Arboreal'' Speed 30 feet; Melee {{OneAction}} branch (reach 15 feet), Damage 2d10 bludgeoning; Melee {{OneAction}} foot, Damage 2d8 bludgeoning; you can speak in this form, but you still can’t [[Cast a Spell]] or supply verbal components.
* ''Flytrap'' Speed 15 feet; resistance 10 to acid; Melee {{OneAction}} leaf (reach 10 feet), Damage 2d8 piercing, and you can spend an action after a hit to [[Grab]] the target.
* ''Shambler'' Speed 20 feet, swim Speed 20 feet; resistance 10 to electricity; Melee {{OneAction}} vine (reach 15 feet), Damage 2d8 slashing. 

''Heightened (6th)'' Your battle form is Huge, and the reach of your attacks increases by 5 feet. You instead gain AC = 22 + your level, 24 temporary HP, attack modifier +21, damage bonus +16, and Athletics +22.
