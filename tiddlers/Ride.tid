When you [[Command an Animal]] you’re mounted on to take a move action (such as [[Stride]]), you automatically succeed instead of needing to attempt a check. 

Any animal you’re mounted on acts on your turn, like a [[Minion]]. If you [[Mount]] an animal in the middle of an encounter, it skips its next turn and then acts on your next turn.
