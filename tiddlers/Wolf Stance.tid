type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

''Requirements'' You are unarmored.

You enter the stance of a wolf, low to the ground with your hands held like fanged teeth. 

You can make wolf jaw unarmed attacks. These deal 1d8 piercing damage; are in the brawling group; and have the [[Agile]], [[Backstabber]], [[Finesse]], [[Nonlethal]], and [[Unarmed]] traits.

If youâ€™re [[Flanking]] a target while in Wolf Stance, your wolf jaw unarmed attacks also gain the [[Trip]] trait.
