Auditory spells rely on sound. 

A spell with the auditory trait has its effect only if the target can hear it. 

This is different from a sonic effect, which still affects targets who canâ€™t hear it (such as deaf targets) as long as the effect makes sound.

//Being [[Deafened]] grants immunity to Auditory effects.//
