Your keen senses and ability to process battlefield information have dramatically improved, allowing you to drastically reduce the advantage of unseen foes. 

You and allies in your overwatch field gain a +2 circumstance bonus when using the [[Seek]] action to find [[Hidden]] or [[Undetected]] creatures within the overwatch field. 

You and your allies donâ€™t have to succeed at a flat check to target a [[Concealed]] creature within your overwatch field. 

When you or an ally targets a [[Hidden]] creature in your overwatch field, reduce the DC of the flat check to 5.
