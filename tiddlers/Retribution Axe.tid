The blade of this +1 greataxe bears a design of a human skull. 

Whenever a creature damages you with an attack, the skull changes its appearance to look like the face of that creature. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your next damage roll against that creature before the end of your next turn. 

Because the face reshapes each time youâ€™re damaged, you get the additional damage only if you attack the creature that damaged you most recently.
