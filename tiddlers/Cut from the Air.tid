''Trigger'' You are the target of a physical ranged [[Strike]].

Requirements Youâ€™re aware of the attack, not [[Flat-Footed]] against it, and either have a hand free or are wielding a melee weapon.

You can knock aside ranged attacks. 

You gain a +4 circumstance bonus to AC against the triggering attack. If the attack misses, you knocked or cut it out of the air.
