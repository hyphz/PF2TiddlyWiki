You take advantage of teleportation to better hide your position. 

When you cast [[Dimensional Assault]], youâ€™re affected by an [[Invisibility]] spell at the end of the teleport. 

You can choose not to make the [[Strike]] that is normally part of dimensional assault. If you do make the Strike, your invisibility ends after the Strike, as normal for invisibility.
