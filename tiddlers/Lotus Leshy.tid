You can walk on the surface of still water and other non-damaging liquids, moving at half your normal Speed. You can attempt to walk along the surface of flowing water as well, still moving at half Speed, but doing so requires a successful [[Acrobatics]] check to [[Balance]] using the DC of a [[Swim]] check to move through the water; on a failure, you fall into the water. This Acrobatics check doesnâ€™t use an action.
