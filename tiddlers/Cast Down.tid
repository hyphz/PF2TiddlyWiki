''Prerequisites'' harmful font or healing font

The sheer force of your faith can bring a foe crashing down. 

If the next action you use is to cast [[Harm]] or [[Heal]] to damage one creature, the target is knocked [[Prone]] if it takes any damage from the spell. 

If the target critically fails its save against the spell, it also takes a â€“10-foot status penalty to its Speed for 1 minute.
