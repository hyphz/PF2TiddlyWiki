Using fantastic acrobatic skill, you can walk for brief stretches across insubstantial surfaces. 

When you [[Stride]], you can move across water, air, and solid surfaces that can hold only limited weight as if they were normal ground. 

If you [[Stride]] over a trap with a weight-sensitive pressure plate, you donâ€™t trigger it. 

At the end of your turn, you sink, fall, break fragile surfaces, or trigger traps as normal for your current location.
