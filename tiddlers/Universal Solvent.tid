title: Universal Solvent
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Originally formulated as a means of dissolving sovereign glue, this powerful solvent can break almost any adhesiveâ€™s grip.

As universal solvent is particularly effective against [[Sovereign Glue]], it automatically dissolves sovereign glue. 

It attempts to counteract any other adhesives, such as [[Tanglefoot Bags]], with a counteract modifier depending on the type.
