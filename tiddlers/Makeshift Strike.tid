You quickly snatch up whateverâ€™s nearby and then attack with it as an improvised weapon. 

You [[Interact]] to pick up a nearby object you could use as an improvised weapon. 

It must be located at around your chest level, such as a mug on a table, rather than an object on the floor. 

You then either [[Strike]] or make an [[Improvised Pummel]] with the improvised weapon.
