{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

You lash a target with tendrils of shadow that steal some of its substance, making it quasi-real. 

As long as it is quasireal, its [[Strike]]s deal half damage, it canâ€™t critically succeed at any skill check, and creatures attempting saving throws against its spells and effects get a result one degree of success better than they rolled. 

The target must attempt a [[Will]] saving throw.
