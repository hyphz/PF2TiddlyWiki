All too aware of your true nature, youâ€™ve studied hags and their powers. 

You gain the trained proficiency rank in [[Deception]] and [[Occultism]]. If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. 

You also become trained in Hag [[Lore]].
