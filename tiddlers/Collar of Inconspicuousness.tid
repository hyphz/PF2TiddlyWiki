This leather collarâ€™s worn and almost threadbare look belies its magical nature. 

When your companion wears and invests the collar, it gains the ability to change its appearance from that of a ferocious animal into a more inconspicuous form.

''Activate'' {{OneAction}} envision; ''Effect'' You touch your animal companion to transform it into a nonthreatening Tiny creature of the same family or a similar creature (for instance, a house cat instead of a tiger, or a puppy instead of a wolf). This has the effects of [[Pest Form]] (2nd level, or 4th level if your companion can fly). The effect lasts until you Dismiss it.

//Although the effect describes touching, the action is tagged <<tag Envision>> not <<tag Interact>>.//
