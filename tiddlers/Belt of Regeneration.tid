type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This belt is crafted from rubbery troll hide thatâ€™s green and orange in color. 

You gain 15 temporary Hit Points the first time you invest the belt in a day. 

When you invest the belt, you either increase your Constitution score by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever would give you a higher score. {{ApexLimit}}

''Activate'' {{OneAction}} Interact; ''Frequency'' once per day; ''Effect'' You tighten the belt one notch to gain a [[Regeneration]] effect. For 2d4 rounds, at the start of your turn each round, you recover 15 Hit Points unless you took <<tag Acid>> or <<tag Fire>> damage since the start of your previous turn.
