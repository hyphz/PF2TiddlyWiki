''Prerequisites'' [[Beast Trainer]] or [[Animal Companion]], [[Orc Ferocity]]

Since ancient times, the mightiest orc beast tamers would draw out the true fighting spirit of their companion beasts by feeding the creatures a draft incorporating the orcâ€™s own blood. 

Animal companions or bonded animals you have gain the [[Orc Ferocity]] feat, and they gain a reaction they can use only for Orc Ferocity. 

If you have the [[Undying Ferocity]] ancestry feat, all animal companions or bonded animals you have also gain the benefits of that feat when using the Orc Ferocity reaction.
