title: Ration Tonic
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This slender vial appears to hold clean, clear water with a faintly fruity scent. 

Drinking a ration tonic magically nourishes you with the equivalent of a dayâ€™s worth of food and water. The tonic has a subtle, pleasant taste, its particulars chosen when the potion is crafted.

A greater ration tonic nourishes you for 1 week instead of 1 day, distributing the nourishment in a constant and healthy flow across the week.
