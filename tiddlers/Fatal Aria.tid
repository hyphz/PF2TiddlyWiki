{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

You perform music so perfect that the target may die of joy or sorrow. 

Once targeted, the creature becomes temporarily immune for 1 minute. 

The effect of the spell depends on the targetâ€™s level and current Hit Points.

''16th or Lower'' The target dies instantly.

''17th'' If the target has 50 Hit Points or fewer, it dies instantly; otherwise, it drops to 0 Hit Points and becomes [[Dying]] 1.

''18th or Higher'' The target takes 50 damage. If this brings it to 0 Hit Points, it dies instantly.
