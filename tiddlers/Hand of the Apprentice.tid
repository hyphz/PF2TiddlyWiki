{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

You hurl a held melee weapon with which you are trained at the target, making a spell attack roll. 

On a success, you deal the weapon’s damage as if you had hit with a melee [[Strike]], but adding your spellcasting ability modifier to damage, rather than your Strength modifier. 

On a critical success, you deal double damage, and you add the weapon’s [[Critical Specialization Effect]]. 

Regardless of the outcome, the weapon flies back to you and returns to your hand.
