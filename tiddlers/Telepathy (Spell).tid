{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

You can communicate telepathically with creatures within 30 feet. 

Once you establish a connection by communicating with a creature, the communication is two-way. 

You can communicate only with creatures that share a language with you.

''Heightened (6th)'' Telepathy loses the linguistic trait. You can communicate telepathically with creatures using shared mental imagery even if you donâ€™t share a language.
