''Usage'' etched onto a thrown weapon

Able to copy itself many times over when thrown until the air is filled with deadly blades, a swarming weapon turns a single weapon into a shower of devastation.

''Activate'' {{TwoAction}} <<tag Command>>, <<tag Envision>>; ''Frequency'' once per hour; ''Effect'' You fling your weapon and it multiplies as it flies through the air, filling a 30-foot [[Cone]]. All creatures within the area take damage equal to double the weaponâ€™s number of damage dice, with a DC 27 basic [[Reflex]] save.
