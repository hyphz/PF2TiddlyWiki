By drawing upon the First Worldâ€™s magic, you can siphon a portion of that malleable world to create a convincing illusion. 

Once per day, you can cast [[Illusory Disguise]], [[Item Facade]], or [[Ventriloquism]]. 

At 7th level, the spell is heightened to 2nd level, and every 2 levels thereafter, the spell is heightened an additional spell level.
