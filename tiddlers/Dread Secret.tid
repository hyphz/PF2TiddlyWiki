{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

You utter a powerful secret at odds with the fundamental nature of the target creatures. 

Choose a specific resistance or weakness that you believe one or more of the targets have due to [[Recall Knowledge]] or previous experience with the targets, such as resistance to <<tag Fire>> or weakness to [[Silver]]. 

If the information is incorrect for a given target, the spell has no effect on that target. 

Affected targets must attempt a [[Will]] saving throw.
