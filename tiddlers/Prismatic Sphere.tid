{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

You create a seven-layered sphere to protect an area. 

This multicolored sphere functions like a [[Prismatic Wall]] but is shaped in a 10-foot [[Burst]] centered on a corner of your space. 

You must form the sphere in an unbroken open space so its edges donâ€™t pass through any creatures or objects, or the spell is lost.
