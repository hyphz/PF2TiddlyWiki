You distract your opponent with a few choice words or a rude gesture. 

Choose a target within 30 feet. 

Itâ€™s [[Flat-Footed]] against your attacks until the end of your next turn. 

Depending on the way you describe your distraction, this action gains either the <<tag Auditory>> or <<tag Visual>> trait.
