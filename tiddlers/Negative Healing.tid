title: Negative Healing
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

A creature with negative healing draws health from negative energy rather than positive energy.

It is damaged by positive damage and is not healed by positive healing effects. 

It does not take negative damage, and it is healed by negative effects that heal undead.

//Note: a creature with Negative Healing is not damaged by positive healing.//
