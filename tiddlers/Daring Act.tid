You attempt a death-defying maneuver to distract your enemies. 

Select one foe within reach and attempt either an [[Acrobatics]] or [[Athletics]] check against your targetâ€™s [[Reflex]] DC. 

If you succeed, you can [[Stride]] up to half your Speed (or up to your full Speed if you critically succeed) without triggering reactions from the target due to your movement, and the target is [[Flat-Footed]] against the next melee attack you attempt against it before the end of your turn.
