''Prerequisites'' [[Blade Ally|Divine Ally]], tenets of evil.

Your blade ally shares your lust for the blood of good creatures. 

Select one enemy you can see.

Until the start of your next turn, your [[Strike]]s against that foe using the weapon your blade ally inhabits deal an extra 4 evil damage, increasing to 6 if you have master proficiency with this weapon.

If the chosen enemy attacks you before the start of your next turn, the duration extends to the end of that enemyâ€™s next turn. If the enemy continues to attack you each turn, the duration
continues to extend.
