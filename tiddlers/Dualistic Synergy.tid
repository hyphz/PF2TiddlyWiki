If your next action is to [[Cast a Spell]] from your spell slots, you gain a benefit. 

If the spell is arcane, you can attempt a skill check to [[Recall Knowledge]] with a +1 status bonus to the check after casting the spell, or a +2 status bonus if the spell is 7th level or higher. 

If the spell is primal, you gain a number of temporary Hit Points equal to the spellâ€™s level for 1 round. 

If the spell is a halcyon spell, you gain both benefits.
