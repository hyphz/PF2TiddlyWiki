You can spread this blue-gray gel on a single item with a Bulk of 3 or less to ward it against magical detection. 

It becomes immune to <<tag Divination>> magic of 8th level or lower (such as locate). 

This oil is permanent, but it can be removed with acid. 

Removing the oil in this way usually takes 1 minute for objects with Bulk of 1 or less, or a number of minutes equal to the itemâ€™s Bulk.
