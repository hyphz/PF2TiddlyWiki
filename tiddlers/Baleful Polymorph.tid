s-crit: The target is unaffected.
s-fail: The target transforms for 1 minute but keeps its mind. If it spends all its actions on its turn concentrating on its original form, it can attempt a [[Will]] save to end the effect immediately.
s-fumble: The target is transformed into the chosen harmless animal, body and mind, for an unlimited duration.
s-hit: The targetâ€™s body gains minor features of the harmless animal. Its insides churn as they partially transform, causing it to be [[Sickened]] 1. When it recovers from the sickened condition, its features revert to normal.
