type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

When displayed prominently, this brass badge makes creatures find you more agreeable. 

You gain a +1 item bonus to [[Diplomacy]] checks.

''Activate'' {{OneAction}} [[Recall Knowledge]]; ''Frequency'' once per day; ''Effect'' Attempt a DC 20 check to [[Recall Knowledge]] about people of a human ethnicity, a non-human ancestry, or some other type of creature. (The GM determines what your options are.) If you succeed, the badgeâ€™s bonus increases to +2 for [[Diplomacy]] checks with creatures of that group for the rest of the day.
