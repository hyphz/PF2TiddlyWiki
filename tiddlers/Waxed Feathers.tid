title: Waxed Feathers
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Your feathers are coated in a waxy substance that repels water. 

You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against effects that have the <<tag Water>> trait. 

So long as youâ€™re in a dry place, you can spend one action to shake off any water that clings to your clothing and feathers to instantly become dry.
