type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

You enchant a piece of ammunition with the magical essence of a precious material, allowing you to leverage certain creaturesâ€™ weaknesses. 

Choose [[Cold Iron]] or [[Silver]]; if you shoot the arrow before the end of your turn, it counts as that material. 

At 14th level, add [[Adamantine]] to the list of materials you can choose from.
