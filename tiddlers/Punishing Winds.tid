type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

Violent winds and a powerful downdraft fill the area, forming a cyclone. 

All flying creatures in the area descend 40 feet. 

The entire area is [[Greater Difficult Terrain|Difficult Terrain]] for Flying creatures, and difficult terrain for creatures on the ground or [[Climb]]ing. 

Any creature that ends its turn Flying within the area descends 20 feet. 

Any creature pushed into a surface by this spellâ€™s winds takes bludgeoning damage as though it had [[fall|Falling]]en.

The squares at the outside vertical edges of the cylinder prevent creatures from leaving. These squares are greater difficult terrain, and a creature attempting to push through must succeed at an [[Athletics]] check or [[Acrobatics]] check to [[Maneuver in Flight]] against your spell DC to get through. A creature that fails ends its current action but can try again.
