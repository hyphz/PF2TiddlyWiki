Choose <<tag Arcane>>, <<tag Divine>>, or <<tag Occult>>. You gain one cantrip from that magical traditionâ€™s spell list. You can cast this spell as an innate spell at will, as a spell of your chosen tradition. A cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up. Whenever you gain a primal innate spell from a gnome ancestry feat, change its tradition from primal to your chosen tradition.
