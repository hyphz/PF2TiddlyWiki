type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Journeybread contains a mix of fruits, nuts, and grains with an alchemical boost. 

Eating one journeybread ({{OneAction}} [[Interact]]) provides all the food and water you need for a day. 

If you subsist on nothing else for a week, you become temporarily immune to journeybread until you eat real food and drink water normally for 24 hours.

In addition to the benefits of journeybread, power journeybread grants you a +1 item bonus to [[Athletics]] checks to [[Climb]], [[Force Open]], and [[Swim]], and to [[Fortitude]] saving throws against being [[Sickened]]. The number of minutes you can [[Hustle]] changes to your [[Constitution]] modifier Ã— 20. These benefits last for 4 hours.
