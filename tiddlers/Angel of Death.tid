All your Strikes against a creature you have [[Marked for Death|Mark for Death]] have the <<tag Death>> trait, causing the mark to be instantly killed when reduced to 0 Hit Points. 

When killed in this way, attempts to communicate with it, return it to life, turn it into an undead, or otherwise disturb its afterlife fail unless the effectâ€™s [[Counteract]] level is higher than half your level when you killed the creature (rounded up), or originates from an artifact or a deity.
