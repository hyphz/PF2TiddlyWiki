type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

You can prepare an additional cantrip, or if you have a repertoire, instead designate a cantrip to add to your repertoire every time you select this ability; you can retrain it but canâ€™t otherwise change it. 

You must be able to prepare cantrips or add them to your repertoire to select this.
