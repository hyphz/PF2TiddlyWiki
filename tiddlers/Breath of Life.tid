''Trigger'' A living creature in range would die.

Your blessing revives a creature at the moment of its death. 

You prevent the target from dying and restore Hit Points to the target equal to 4d8 plus your spellcasting ability modifier. 

You canâ€™t use breath of life if the triggering effect was [[Disintegrate]] or a [[Death]] effect.
