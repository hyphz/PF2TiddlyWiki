You manipulate the energy of your spell, causing it to affect a wider area. 

If the next action you use is to [[Cast a Spell]] that has an area of a burst, cone, or line and does not have a duration, increase the area of that spell. 

Add 5 feet to the radius of a burst that normally has a radius of at least 10 feet (a burst with a smaller radius is not affected). 

Add 5 feet to the length of a cone or line that is normally 15 feet long or smaller, and add 10 feet to the length of a larger cone or line.
