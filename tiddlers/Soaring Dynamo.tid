Youâ€™ve built clockwork wings or jets into your dynamo, allowing you to use your prosthesis to fly. 

You gain a fly Speed equal to your Speed. 

Each minute of flight reduces the operational time of your sterling dynamo by 1 hour, measured from the first time you use the [[Fly]] action in a given minute.
