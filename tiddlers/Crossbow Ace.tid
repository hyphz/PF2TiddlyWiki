You have a deep understanding of the crossbow. 

When youâ€™re wielding a crossbow and use [[Hunt Prey]] or use [[Interact]] to reload your crossbow, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the damage roll on your next [[Strike]] with that crossbow. 

If the crossbow is a simple crossbow, also increase the damage die size for that attack by one step. 

You must make the attack before the end of your next turn or these benefits are lost.
