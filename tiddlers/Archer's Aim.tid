You slow down, focus, and take a careful shot. 

Make a ranged [[Strike]] with a weapon in the bow weapon group.

You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the attack roll and ignore the targetâ€™s [[Concealed]] condition. 

If the target is [[Hidden]], reduce the flat check from being hidden from 11 to 5.
