You gain imprecise [[Scent]] with a range of 30 feet. This means you can use your sense of smell to determine a creature’s location. The GM will usually double the range if you’re downwind from the creature or halve the range if you’re upwind. In addition, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to [[Track]] a creature or object if you’ve smelled it before.
