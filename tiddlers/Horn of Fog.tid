title: Horn of Fog
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This large ramâ€™s horn perpetually glistens with tiny droplets of water, much like condensation.

''Activate'' {{TwoAction}} [[Interact]]; ''Frequency'' once per hour; ''Effect'' You activate the horn by blowing deeply into it, causing it to issue forth a low blast and cast a 2nd-level [[Obscuring Mist]] spell. 

You can [[Dismiss]] the mist at any time by blowing a second note on the horn using an [[Interact]] action.
