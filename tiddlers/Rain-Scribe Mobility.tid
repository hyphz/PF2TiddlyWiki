title: Rain-Scribe Mobility
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

You surround yourself in a mantle of Rain-Scribe magic and [[Stride]] twice; [[Difficult Terrain]] does not reduce your Speed, even if the difficult terrain has been manipulated by magic. 

Your magic clears the difficult terrain in each square you entered; until your next turn, those squares arenâ€™t difficult terrain for any creature walking through them (or are normal difficult terrain if they were previously greater difficult terrain).
