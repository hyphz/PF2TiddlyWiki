{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

You create an immobile globe around yourself that attempts to [[Counteract]] any spell from outside the globe whose area or targets enter into the globe, as if the globe were a [[Dispel Magic]] spell 1 level lower than its actual spell level. 

If the counteract attempt succeeds, it prevents only the portion of the spell that would have entered the globe (so if the spell also has targets outside the globe, or part of its area is beyond the globe, those targets or that area is affected normally). 

You must form the sphere in an unbroken open space, so its edges donâ€™t pass through any creatures or objects, or the spell is lost (though creatures can enter the globe after the spell is cast).
