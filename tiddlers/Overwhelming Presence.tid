{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

You surround yourself with supernatural splendor, appearing to be a god or similarly majestic being. You choose the aspects of your new majestic appearance. 

This causes the targets to pay tribute to you by bowing or using some other action in keeping with your appearance. 

Paying tribute is a <<tag Manipulate>>action or <<tag Move>>action, as chosen by the creature paying tribute. 

A creature under this effect must pay tribute to you at least once on each of its turns if possible. 

The number of times a target must do this depends on the result of their Will save.

While affected by this spell, a creature is [[Fascinated]] by you and canâ€™t use [[Hostile Action]]s against you. 

The target is then temporarily immune for 1 minute.
