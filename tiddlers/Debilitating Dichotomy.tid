{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

You reveal a glimpse of the impossible conflicts between the divine anathema behind your curse, forcing you to reckon with anotherâ€™s conflicts as well. 

You and the target each take 9d6 <<tag Mental>> damage with a basic [[Will]] save, and the target is [[Stunned]] 1 if it critically fails its save. 

You get a degree of success one better than you rolled for your saving throw.

''Heightened (+1)'' The damage increases by 3d6.
