''Requirements'' You have pledged your service to a specific organization or ideal.

You fly the banner of your pledge from your mount, raising your alliesâ€™ spirits. 

You and all allies within 30 feet gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [[Will]] saves and DCs against <<tag Fear>> effects.

If your banner is destroyed or removed, allies within 30 feet become [[Frightened]] 1.
