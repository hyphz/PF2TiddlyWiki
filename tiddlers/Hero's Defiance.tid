{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

''Trigger'' An attack would bring you to 0 hit points.

You shout in defiance, filling you with a sudden burst of healing. 

Just before applying the attack’s damage, you recover 10d4+20 Hit Points. If this is enough to prevent the attack from bringing you to 0 Hit Points, you don’t become [[Unconscious]] or [[Dying]].

Either way, cheating death is difficult, and you can’t use hero’s defiance again until you [[Refocus]] or the next time you prepare.

Hero’s defiance cannot be used against effects with the <<tag Death>>trait or that would leave no remains, such as [[Disintegrate]].
