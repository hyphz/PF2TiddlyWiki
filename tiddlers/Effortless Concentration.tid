''Requirement'' You havenâ€™t acted yet on your turn.

You can maintain a spell with hardly a thought. 

You immediately gain the effects of a [[Sustain a Spell]] action, allowing you to extend the duration of one of your active spells.

//You can only use this action on spells gained from the class which gave you this action.//
