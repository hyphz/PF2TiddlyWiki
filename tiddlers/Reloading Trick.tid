''Frequency'' once per round.

''Requirements'' Youâ€™re holding an unloaded hand crossbow.

You can fire off a single shot even when unprepared. 

You [[Interact]] to reload your hand crossbow and [[Strike]] with it.

''Special'' If you have the [[Repeating Hand Crossbow Training]] feat, you can use this feat with a repeating hand crossbow to load either a bolt or a magazine, but the speed means you can fire only one bolt, then the magazine jams. You must spend a 3-action [[Interact]] activity to remove the jammed magazine and clear it before it can be used again.
