Affix to armor.

''Requirements'' You are an expert in [[Intimidation]].

''Trigger'' You attempt an [[Intimidation]] check to [[Coerce]] or [[Demoralize]], but you havenâ€™t rolled yet.

This talisman comes in many forms, most often a severed piece of a humanoid creature displayed in some gruesome manner. 

When you activate the trophy, select two targets and compare your [[Intimidation]] check result to both of their DCs.
