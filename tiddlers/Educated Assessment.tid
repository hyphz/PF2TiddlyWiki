type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

You attempt to [[Recall Knowledge]] about a creature, and the GM uses the same secret roll result against the creatureâ€™s [[Deception]] or [[Stealth]] DC, giving you the information from a [[Battle Assessment]]. 

You might get a different degree of success on the Recall Knowledge check than what you get for the Battle Assessment. 

If you have the [[Battle Assessment]] feat, you gain the effects of Educated Assessment whenever you Recall Knowledge (such as with the [[Automatic Knowledge]] feat).
