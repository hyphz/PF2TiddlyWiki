{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

''Trigger'' A creature's [[Dying]] condition would reach the value at which they would die.

Your ode temporarily staves off death. 

The target’s dying condition remains 1 below the value at which it dies. 

This doesn’t help prevent death from effects that kill the target without increasing its dying condition, such as [[Disintegrate]] and <<tag Death>> effects.
