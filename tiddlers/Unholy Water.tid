type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

An evil deity’s malice lies within this vial of water. 

You activate a vial of unholy water by throwing it as a [[Strike]]. It’s a simple thrown weapon with a range increment of 20 feet. Unlike an alchemical bomb, it doesn’t add the manipulate trait to the attack made with it.

Unholy water deals 1d6 evil damage and 1 evil splash damage. It damages only celestials and creatures that have a weakness to evil damage.
