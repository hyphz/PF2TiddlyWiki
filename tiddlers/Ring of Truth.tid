title: Ring of Truth
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This ring appears to be a [[Ring of Lies]], but when invested, close investigation reveals angelic wings and divine creatures hidden on the face of the ring. 

When you invest the ring, you are rendered unable to tell a deliberate lie, in either speech or writing. If you attempt to omit the truth or phrase things truthfully but deceptively, roll a DC 11 flat check; on a failure, the ring itself blurts out the entire truth (as you believe it) as an answer. 

Keeping silent does not activate the ringâ€™s curse.

Once the curse has activated for the first time, the ring fuses to you.
