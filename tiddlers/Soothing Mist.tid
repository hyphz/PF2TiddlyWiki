{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

You call forth a magical mist of positive energy that envelops a creature. 

The mist restores 2d8 Hit Points to a target living creature and ends one source of persistent <<tag Acid>>, <<tag Bleed>>, <<tag Fire>>, <<tag Negative>>, or <<tag Poison>> damage affecting it. 

If the creature is taking persistent damage from multiple sources, you select which one is removed. 

Against an <<tag Undead>> target, you deal 2d8 positive damage (basic [[Fortitude]] save); if it fails the save, it also takes 2 persistent positive damage.

''Heightened (+1)'' The amount of healing (or damage to an undead target) increases by 1d8, and the persistent positive damage to an undead creature increases by 1.
