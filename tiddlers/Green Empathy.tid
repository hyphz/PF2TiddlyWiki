You can communicate with plants on a basic level and use [[Diplomacy]] to [[Make an Impression]] on them and to make very simple [[Request]]s of them. 

Non-creature plants typically canâ€™t fulfill most requests you might ask of them unless you have access to other magic such as [[Speak with Plants]]. 

Because of your affiliation with the leaf order, plants have a sense that you support them, so you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on your check to Make a [[Request]] of a plant using Green Empathy.
