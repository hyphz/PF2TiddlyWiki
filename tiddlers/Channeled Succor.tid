''Prerequisites'' healing font.

You can remove conditions with divine grace. 

You can sacrifice one [[Heal]] spell youâ€™ve prepared in your extra slots from healing font to cast one of the following spells instead: [[Remove Curse]], [[Remove Disease]], [[Remove Paralysis]], or [[Restoration]]. 

The spell is heightened to the same level as the heal spell you sacrificed.
