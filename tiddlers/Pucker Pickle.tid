title: Pucker Pickle
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Sharp and pungent, but tasty, pucker pickles were created by goblin alchemists working to avoid being eaten by larger creatures. 

For 1 hour after eating a pucker pickle, you smell slightly of pickle, but you have a horrendous taste. 

Once a creature hits you with a [[Strike]] using an attack that allows it to taste you, such as a jaws Strike, it takes a â€“2 circumstance penalty to further attacks against you that allow it to taste you, including attacks like [[Grappling|Grapple]] or [[Trip]]ping you using its jaws or [[Swallowing you Whole|Swallow Whole]]. 

Creatures, especially <<tag Animal>>s, often choose other targets after tasting you. 

Any creature that [[Engulf]]s you or [[Swallows you Whole|Swallow Whole]] is [[Sickened]] 1. If it spends an action retching to reduce the sickened condition, you can attempt to [[Escape]] as a reaction.
