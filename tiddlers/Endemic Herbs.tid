During your daily preparations, you find medicinal plants endemic to your location. 

Until your next preparations, you can spend an additional batch of herbs to add a benefit to an item you create with your herbalism. 

The benefit of the special herbs affects the creature that the item is applied to; if the benefit is not immediate, it lasts for 1 minute unless otherwise stated. 

This adjustment counts as an <<tag Additive>>, so you canâ€™t include another additive without spoiling the item.

* ''Aquatic'' Gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [[Fortitude]] saves.
* ''Arctic'' For 1 hour, treat environmental cold effects as if they were one step less severe.
* ''Desert'' For 1 hour, treat environmental heat effects as if they were one step less severe.
* ''Forest'' Gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saves against disease and poison effects.
* ''Mountain'' Gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Reflex saves.
* ''Plains'' Gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Will saves.
* ''Swamp'' Remove one source of persistent bleed damage.
* ''Underground'' Gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Perception.
