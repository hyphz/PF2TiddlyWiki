''Frequency'' once per turn

''Requirements'' Your most recent action was to [[Cast a Spell]] from a spell slot or make a [[Spellstrike]] with a spell from a spell slot.

Your spell has a powerful aftereffect, briefly granting you a certain spell depending on the spell you cast. 

You use [[Arcane Cascade]] and are subject to an additional aftereffect spell depending on the school of your most recent spell. 

This aftereffect spellâ€™s duration lasts until the end of your next turn or its normal duration, whichever is longer. 

Using Arcane Shroud again ends any existing spell you gained from Arcane Shroud.
