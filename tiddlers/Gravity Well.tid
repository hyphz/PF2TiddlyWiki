{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

You create a sphere of altered gravity. 

All creatures and unsecured objects in the area move towards the center, depending on their [[Reflex]] saving throws. This follows the rules for [[Forced Movement]].

If thereâ€™s not enough space near the center of the sphere, creatures and objects nearer to the center move first, and others move as far as they can without being blocked, up to the amount set by their saving throw outcomes.
