{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

Fleeting notes of a strange and unnatural song fill the air, overtaking the mind. 

Each target must attempt a [[Will]] save when you cast the spell, and again each time you [[Sustain the Spell|Sustain a Spell]]. 

A creature needs to attempt only one save against the song each round, and you have to keep the same targets when you Sustain the Spell.
