{{AoA5Feat}}

Through a combination of careful manipulation and precise breath control, you can deploy inhaled toxins precisely. 

When you activate an inhaled poison, you can cause it to fill a 20-foot [[Line]] thatâ€™s 5 feet tall rather than a 10-foot [[Cube]]. 

You gain a +3 status bonus to saving throws against inhaled poisons that you activate.
