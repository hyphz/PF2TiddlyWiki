{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

A divine beacon radiates serenity, soothing nearby allies.

Allies within the area gain a +1 status bonus to saving throws against <<tag Emotion>> effects. 

An ally can touch the font as an [[Interact]] action; if they do so, the spell attempts to [[Counteract]] one emotion effect affecting the ally of the allyâ€™s choice, after which that emotion effect is temporarily immune for 1 day.

If the spell succeeds at the counteract check, it removes the emotion effect from your ally, though not from any other creatures the effect might be affecting.

''Heightened (+4)'' The bonus increases by 1.
