You swiftly assess your prey and apply what you know.

As part of the action used to [[Hunt your Prey|Hunt Prey]], you can attempt a check to [[Recall Knowledge]] about your prey.

When you critically succeed at identifying your hunted prey with [[Recall Knowledge]], you note a weakness in the creatureâ€™s defenses. You and allies you tell gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your next attack roll against that prey. 

You can give bonuses from Monster Hunter only once per day against a particular creature.
