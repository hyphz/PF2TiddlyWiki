{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

You transform the target into delicious fare, changing water into wine or another fine beverage or enhancing the foodâ€™s taste and ingredients to make it a gourmet treat.

Prior to the transformation, the spell attempts to [[Counteract]] any <<tag Poison>>s in the food or water. 

The food turns back to normal if not consumed before the duration expires, though any poisons that were counteracted are still gone.

''Heightened (+1)'' The number of gallons of water you can target increases by 1, or the number of pounds of food you can target increases by 5.
