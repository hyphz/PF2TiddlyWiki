type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

''Requirements'' Youâ€™re wielding a staff.

You spin your staff with a twirling flourish, attacking two foes and transforming the momentum into magical energy to charge for your next Spellstrike. 

Make a melee [[Strike]] with your staff against one foe and then a second melee [[Strike]] with your staff against a different foe. Your multiple attack penalty applies to both of these attacks
as normal.

//In spite of the first sentence, nothing in the spell description gives it any effect on recharging Spellstrike.//
