Your earth elemental ancestorâ€™s influence manifests in you as dust and dirt, like the soil of a field or the hot desert sands. 

You gain the trained proficiency rank in [[Survival]]. If you would automatically become trained in Survival (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. 

You can sustain yourself on dirt and ash instead of normal food and water.
