{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

The target makes no sound, preventing creatures from noticing it using hearing or other senses alone. 

The target canâ€™t use <<tag Sonic>>attacks, nor can it use actions with the <<tag Auditory>>trait. 

This prevents it from casting spells that include <<tag Verbal>>components.

''Heightened (4th)'' The spell effect emanates from the touched creature, silencing all sound in or passing through a 10-foot radius and preventing any auditory and sonic effects in the affected area. While within the radius, creatures are subject to the same effects as the target. Depending upon the position of the effect, a creature might notice the lack of sound reaching it (blocking off the noise coming from a party, for example).
