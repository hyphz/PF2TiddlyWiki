type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Stored in a small reed, this powder looks like a fine metallic dust. 

When you fling it in the air ({{OneAction}} Interact), it coats all creatures in a 10-foot burst centered on a point within 5 feet of you. 

For 1 minute, the coated creatures canâ€™t be [[Concealed]] or [[Invisible]], nor can they benefit from [[Mirror Image]] or similar abilities that create illusory duplicates. 

Any illusions in the area of 3rd level or lower are revealed as such, although this does not end their effect.
