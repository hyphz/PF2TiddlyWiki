''Requirements'' You have a fly Speed.

You move through the air up to your fly Speed. 

Moving upward (straight up or diagonally) uses the rules for moving through [[Difficult Terrain]]. 

You can move straight down 10 feet for every 5 feet of movement you spend. 

If you Fly to the ground, you don’t take [[Falling]] damage. 

You can use an action to Fly 0 feet to hover in place. 

If you’re airborne at the end of your turn and didn’t use a Fly action this round, you fall.
