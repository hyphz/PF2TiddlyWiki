{{LOWGFeat}}

''Prerequisites'' expert in heavy armor.

Youâ€™ve learned how best to move in heavy armor. 

When wearing heavy armor, if you meet the Strength requirement, instead of reducing the movement penalty by 5 feet, you reduce the penalty by 10 feet (typically reducing the penalty to 0). 

If you are a dwarf with the [[Unburdened Iron]] feat, increase your Speed by 5 feet.
