''Requirements'' You are adjacent to a creature that is at least one size larger than you and is willing to be your mount.

You move onto the creature and ride it. 

//If you have the [[Ride]] feat, the creature skips its next turn and acts as a [[Minion]] under your control on your next turn. If you don't, you have to use [[Command an Animal]] to tell the mount what to do.//

If youâ€™re already mounted, you can instead use this action to dismount, moving off the mount into a space adjacent to it.
