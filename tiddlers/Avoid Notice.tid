title: Avoid Notice
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

You attempt a [[Stealth]] check to avoid notice while traveling at half speed. 

If you have the [[Swift Sneak]] feat, you can move at full Speed rather than half, but you still can’t use another exploration activity while you do so. 

If you have the [[Legendary Sneak]] feat, you can move at full Speed and use a second exploration activity. 

If you’re Avoiding Notice at the start of an encounter, you usually roll a Stealth check instead of a Perception check both to determine your initiative and to see if the enemies notice you (based on their Perception DCs, as normal for Sneak, regardless of their initiative check results).
