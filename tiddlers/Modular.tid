title: Modular
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The weapon has multiple configurations that you can switch between using an [[Interact]] action. 

Typically, switching between configurations of a modular weapon allows it to deal different types of damage (listed in the trait, such as “modular B, P, or S”), though it’s possible for a modular weapon’s description to list more complicated configurations.
