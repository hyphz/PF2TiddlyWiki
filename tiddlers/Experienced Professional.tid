''Prerequisites'' Trained in [[Lore]].

You carefully safeguard your professional endeavors to prevent disaster. 

When you use Lore to [[Earn Income]], if you roll a critical failure, you instead get a failure. 

If youâ€™re an expert in Lore, you gain twice as much income from a failed check to Earn Income,
unless it was originally a critical failure.
