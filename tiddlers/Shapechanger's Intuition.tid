A lifetime of experience helps you see through disguises. 

When you come within 10 feet of a creature that is transformed into another form or is [[Impersonating|Impersonate]] a specific creature, the GM rolls a secret [[Perception]] check for you to realize that the creature is transformed, even if you didnâ€™t spend an action to [[Seek]] against that creature.
