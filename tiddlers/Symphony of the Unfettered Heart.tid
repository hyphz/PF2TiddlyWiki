{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

Your symphony lifts listeners from their worldly concerns.

Attempt a [[Performance]] check to [[Counteract]] one of the following conditions affecting the target: [[Grabbed]], [[Immobilized]], [[Paralyzed]], [[Restrained]], [[Slowed]], or [[Stunned]]. 

If you fail, you can’t target that effect on the target for 1 day. 

Use the condition’s source to determine the counteract DC (for example, the [[Escape]] DC for grabbed).

''Heightened (9th)'' You can target up to four creatures.
