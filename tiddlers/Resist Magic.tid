''Trigger'' You attempt a saving throw against a harmful magical effect but havenâ€™t rolled yet.

Your innate magic protects you. 

You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the triggering saving throw. 

Additionally, if the triggering effect is <<tag Arcane>>, if you roll a success, you get a critical success instead.
