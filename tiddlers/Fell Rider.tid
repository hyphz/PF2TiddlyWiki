You have trained with your [[animal companion|Animal Companions]] to become a terrifying, unified juggernaut on the battlefield. 

Your animal companion becomes trained in [[Intimidation]]. 

If your animal companion uses [[Support]] while serving as your mount, it grants you the effects of the [[Aid]] reaction on your first [[Intimidation]] check to [[Demoralize]] on the same turn, even though it canâ€™t take reactions.
