Youâ€™ve spent more than your share of time in an alchemy lab. You might have been an alchemist yourself, an assistant, or perhaps even a test subject. Either way, you have been exposed to a wide variety of alchemical poisons and elixirs, leaving you with increased tolerance of their effects. 

You have a +1 circumstance bonus to saves against [[Poison]] and harmful effects from [[Elixir]]s. If you roll a success on your saving throw against an elixir or poison, you get a critical success instead.
