This [[+1|Weapon Potency]] [[Striking]] [[Ghost Touch]] crossbow has an array of crystalline lenses and silver fittings along the stock and feels strangely light.

''Activate'' {{OneAction}} envision; ''Frequency'' once per minute; ''Effect'' You aim through the crossbowâ€™s crystalline lenses, gaining [[Imprecise]] vision onto the Ethereal Plane with a range of 60 feet in addition to your normal senses for the rest of your turn. While this effect lasts, your next [[Strike]] with the spiritsight crossbow can also affect targets on the Ethereal Plane during the first 60 feet of its flight.
