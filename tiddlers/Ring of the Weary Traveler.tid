This fanciful golden ring has an ornate band cast with delicate, swirling decorations and is inlaid with three bright-green emeralds. 

While wearing this ring, you gain a +10-foot item bonus to your Speed, but only when determining your overland movement per hour.

''Activate'' {{ThreeAction}} (envision, interact); ''Effect'' You refresh yourself from fatigue. For 10 minutes, you can ignore the penalties from the [[Fatigued]] condition. This does not remove the condition, it merely suppresses the penalties and drawbacks of having the condition. 

If something would cause you to become fatigued again while the ringâ€™s power is in effect, the suppression ends, and you immediately take the penalties again.
