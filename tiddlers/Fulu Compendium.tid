title: Fulu Compendium
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This pamphlet-sized book records the various symbols seen on fulu and also contains some ready-made magic on a special page that restores itself every day at sunrise.

Using the compendium as a reference grants a +2 item bonus to any skill checks to determine a fuluâ€™s function or authenticity.

''Activate'' {{TwoAction}} [[Interact]]; ''Frequency'' once per day; ''Effect'' You rip a page from the fulu compendium and cast it in a wide arc; as it flies in that arc, it multiplies into a storm of fulus. All undead creatures in a 30-foot [[Emanation]] are affected by a [[Spirit-Sealing Fulu]] with a save DC of 25.
