{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

You raise a blazing wall that burns creatures passing through it. 

You create either a 5-foot-thick [[Wall]] of flame in a straight line up to 60 feet long and 10 feet high, or a 5-foot-thick, 10-foot-radius ring of flame with the same height. 

The wall stands vertically in either form; if you wish, the wall can be of a shorter length or height. 

Everything on each side of the wall is [[Concealed]] from creatures on the opposite side. 

Any creature that crosses the wall or is occupying the wallâ€™s area at the start of its turn takes 4d6 <<tag Fire>>damage.

''Heightened (+1)'' The fire damage increases by 1d6.
