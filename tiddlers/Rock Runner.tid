Your innate connection to stone makes you adept at moving across uneven surfaces. 

You can ignore [[Difficult Terrain]] caused by rubble and uneven ground made of stone and earth.

In addition, when you use the [[Acrobatics]] skill to [[Balance]] on narrow surfaces or uneven ground made of stone or earth, you arenâ€™t [[Flat-Footed]], and when you roll a success at one of these Acrobatics checks, you get a critical success instead.
