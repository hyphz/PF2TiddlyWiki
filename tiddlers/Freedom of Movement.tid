{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

You repel effects that would hinder a creature or slow its movement. 

While under this spellâ€™s effect, the target ignores effects that would give them a circumstance penalty to Speed. 

When they attempt to [[Escape]] an effect that has them [[Immobilized]], [[Grabbed]], or [[Restrained]], they automatically succeed unless the effect is magical and of a higher level than the freedom of movement spell.
