You grew up riding your clanâ€™s shaggy ponies and riding dogs. 

You become trained in [[Nature]]. If you would automatically become trained in Nature (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. 

You also get a +1 circumstance bonus to [[Command an Animal]] if the target is a traditional halfling mount, such as a pony or riding dog.
