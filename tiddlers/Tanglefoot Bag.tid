title: Tanglefoot Bag
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

A tanglefoot bag is filled with sticky substances. 

When you hit a creature with a tanglefoot bag, that creature takes a status penalty to its Speeds for 1 minute. Many types of tanglefoot bag also grant an item bonus on attack rolls.

On a critical hit, a creature in contact with a solid surface becomes stuck to the surface and [[Immobilized]] for 1 round, and a creature flying via wings has its wings tangled, causing it to fall safely to the ground and become unable to [[Fly]] again for 1 round. 

Tanglefoot bags are not effective when used on a creature that is in water.

The target can end any effects by [[Escaping|Escape]] or spending a total of 3 [[Interact]] actions to carefully remove the sticky substances. These Interact actions donâ€™t have to be consecutive, and other creatures can provide the actions as well.
