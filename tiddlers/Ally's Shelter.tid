''Frequency'' once per day.

''Trigger'' You attempt a saving throw while adjacent to one or more allies, but you haven’t rolled yet.

In stressful circumstances, you find strength in your allies’ example. 

Roll the save using an adjacent ally’s modifier for that type of saving throw instead of your own.
