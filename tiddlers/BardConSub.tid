If you’re a [[Bard]] Casting a Spell from the [[Occult]] tradition while holding a musical instrument, you can __can usually play an instrument for spells requiring somatic or material components, as long as it takes at least one of your hands to do so. If you use an instrument, you don’t need a spell component pouch or another hand free. You can usually also play an instrument for spells requiring verbal components, instead of speaking.__
