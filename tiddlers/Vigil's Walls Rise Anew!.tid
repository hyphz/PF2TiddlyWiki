As part of daily preparation, you can drill with a number of allies up to your [[Charisma]] modifier. These allies must be present and listening during this time, but this does not otherwise impede their own preparation. 

When you use this featâ€™s benefit, you and all drilled companions within 30 feet who are wielding shields [[Raise a Shield]]. Allies who Raise their Shields keep them raised until the start of their next turn, as normal.
