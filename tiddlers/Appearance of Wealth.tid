{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

You create a brief vision of immense wealth filling the spellâ€™s area. 

Each creature within 20 feet of the area that could be enticed by material wealth must attempt a [[Will]] saving throw. 

A creature that enters the area automatically disbelieves the illusion, and disbelieving the illusion ends any fascinated condition imposed by the spell. 

As long as you [[Sustain the Spell|Sustain a Spell]], other creatures react to the treasure like they would any other illusion, but they are not at risk of becoming fascinated.
