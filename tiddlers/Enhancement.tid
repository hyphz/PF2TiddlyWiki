title: Enhancement
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Automatons are built to receive enhancements and modifications to their bodies. 

Many automaton ancestry feats have an “Enhancement” line that represents a possible augmentation you can acquire. 

You don’t gain the benefits of the enhancement unless you take a feat that grants you those benefits, such as [[Lesser Augmentation]].

You can only gain the enhancements of a given feat once.
