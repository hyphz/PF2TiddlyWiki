You have a keen sense for avoiding spurious lines of inquiry.

When you [[Pursue a Lead]], the GM tells you if the lead you chose is inconsequential. For example, if you found a splatter of gray mud on the wall, thought it was suspicious, and Pursued it as a Lead, the GM would tell you if there was no greater mystery related to it. 

When the GM tells you a lead is inconsequential, you can decline to Pursue the Lead, keeping any leads you were already pursuing. You still canâ€™t use Pursue a Lead again for 10 minutes, as normal.
