Once per day when you use [[Advanced Alchemy]] during your daily preparations, you can spend a batch of infused reagents to create a wish vial containing a single common arcane spell of your choice of 8th level or lower. (//But not actually Wish.//)

The spell must have a casting time of no more than 3 actions, no Cost, and must be able to target you. 

Only you can Activate the wish vial, which takes the same number of [[Interact]] actions as the spellâ€™s casting time and grants you the effects of the spell.
