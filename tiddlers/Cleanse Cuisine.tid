{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

You transform __all food and beverages in the area__ into delicious fare, changing water into wine or another fine beverage or enhancing the foodâ€™s taste and ingredients to make it a gourmet treat.

__You can also choose to remove all toxins and contaminations from the food.__

__This spell doesn't prevent future contamination, natural decay, or spoilage, nor does it make the food any more nutritious.__

''Heightened (+1)'' Add another cubic foot to the area, which must be contigous with the rest.

//Remaster: level lowered to 1, works on an area instead of one item, no longer takes a minute to cast, and always removes poisons instead of trying to counteract them.//
