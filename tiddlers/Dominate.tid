{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

You take command of the target, forcing it to obey your orders.

The effect depends on its [[Will]] save.

If you issue an obviously self-destructive order, the target doesnâ€™t act until you issue a new order. 

//This does not give the target the Controlled status.//

''Heightened (10th)'' The duration is unlimited.
