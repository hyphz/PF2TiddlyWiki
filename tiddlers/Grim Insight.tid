Othersâ€™ attempts to scare you often grant you insights about your would-be bullies that you can then exploit. 

If you roll a success on a saving throw against a <<tag Fear>> effect, you get a critical success instead, and the source of the fear effect is [[Flat-Footed]] to you until the end of your next turn.

//(Presumably this flat-footing also happens if you roll a critical success.)//
