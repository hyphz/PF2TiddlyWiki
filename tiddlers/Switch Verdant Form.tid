''Implied by [[Verdant Metamorphosis]].''

You can change from a form that looks mostly like your old self into a tree or any other non creature plant as a single action, which has the Concentrate trait. This has the same effect as [[Tree Shape]], except you can turn into any kind of non-creature plant and your AC is 30.
