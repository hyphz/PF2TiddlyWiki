{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

Your deity sends wracking plagues. 

The target must attempt a [[Fortitude]] save. 

When you Cast the Spell, decide whether the disease inflicts the [[Clumsy]], [[Enfeebled]], or [[Stupefied]] condition.

{{||SaveSuccessTable}}

''Divine Plague (disease)'' Level 1; ''Stage 1'' //Your chosen condition// 1 (1 round); Stage 2 [[Slowed]] 1 and //your chosen condition// 1 (1 round); Stage 3 //Your chosen condition// 1 and the target canâ€™t recover from the condition until they are cured (1 day)

''Heightened (5th)'' The divine plague disease gains the [[Virulent]] trait. The condition value for the clumsy, enfeebled, or stupefied condition is 2 instead of 1.
