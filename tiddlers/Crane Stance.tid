type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

''Requirements'' You are unarmored.

You enter the stance of a crane, holding your arms in an imitation of a craneâ€™s wings and using flowing, defensive motions. 

You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to AC, but the only Strikes you can make are crane wing attacks. These deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage; are in the brawling group; and have the [[Agile]], [[Finesse]], [[Nonlethal]], and [[Unarmed]] traits.

While in Crane Stance, reduce the DC for [[High Jump]] and [[Long Jump]] by 5, and when you [[Leap]], you can move an additional 5 feet horizontally or 2 feet vertically.
