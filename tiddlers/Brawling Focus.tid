You know how to make the most of your attacks when fighting hand-to-hand. 

You gain access to the [[Critical Specialization Effects]] of unarmed strikes in the brawling group and weapons in the brawling group. 

If you have [[Monastic Weaponry]], you also gain the critical specialization effects of all monk weapons in which you are trained.
