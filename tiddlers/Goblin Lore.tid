//"Goblin Lore" is a 1st level Ancestry feat for goblins. If you're just looking for the Lore skill regarding Goblins, look at [[Lore]].//

Youâ€™ve picked up skills and tales from your goblin community. 

You gain the trained proficiency rank in [[Nature]] and [[Stealth]].

If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. 

You also become trained in Goblin [[Lore]].
