''Prerequisites'' Trained in [[Society]].

You were raised among the nobility or have learned proper etiquette and bearing, allowing you to present yourself as a noble and play games of influence and politics. 

You can use Society to [[Make an Impression]] on a noble, as well as with [[Impersonate]] to pretend to be a noble if you arenâ€™t one. 

If you want to impersonate a specific noble, you still need to use [[Deception]] to Impersonate normally, and to [[Lie]] when necessary.
