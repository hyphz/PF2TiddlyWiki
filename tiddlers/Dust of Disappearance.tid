title: Dust of Disappearance
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This powder shimmers like a thousand tiny motes of light.

Activating the dust by sprinkling it on yourself or a creature within reach ({{OneAction}} Interact) casts a 4th-level [[Invisibility]] spell with a duration of 1 minute on that creature. 

This invisibility canâ€™t be negated or seen through by any spell of 3rd level or lower or any item of 5th level or lower.
