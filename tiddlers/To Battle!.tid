With a resounding cry, you rally your ally to the offensive.

Choose one ally within your marshalâ€™s aura who has a reaction available. 

If you spend 1 action, that ally can use their reaction to immediately [[Stride]]. 

If you spend 2 actions, that ally can use their reaction to immediately [[Strike]].
