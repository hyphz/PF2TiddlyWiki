''Requirements'' You are in [[Tiger Stance]].

You make a fierce swipe with both hands. 

Make a tiger claw [[Strike]]. 

It deals two extra weapon damage dice (three extra dice if youâ€™re 14th level or higher), and you can push the target 5 feet away as if you had successfully [[Shove]]d them. 

If the attack is a critical success and deals damage, add your [[Strength]] modifier to the persistent bleed damage from your tiger claw.
