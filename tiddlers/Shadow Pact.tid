{{LOCGFeat}}

You can take 1 damage to mix blood and shadows to cast 5th-level [[Creation]] as an innate divine spell. 

You can use this ability as often as you wish, but you can have only one such object in existence at a time. 

If the object encounters [[Bright Light]], the spell ends and the object dissolves into shadows.
