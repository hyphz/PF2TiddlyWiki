''Frequency'' Once per day.

Energy bursts forth from your body. 

You deal 1d6 damage of //the type chosen when you picked [[Elemental Heart Dwarf]]// to all adjacent creatures (basic [[Reflex]] save using your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher). 

At 3rd level, and every 2 levels thereafter, this damage increases by 1d6.
