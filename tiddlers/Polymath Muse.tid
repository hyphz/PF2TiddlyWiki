title: Polymath Muse
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Your muse is a jack of all trades, flitting between skills and pursuits. If it’s is a creature, it might be an eclectic creature like a fey. As a bard with a polymath muse, you are interested in a wide array of topics but rarely dedicated to any one, and you rarely make up your mind—you want to try everything. 

You gain the [[Versatile Performance]] feat and add [[Unseen Servant]] to your spell repertoire.
