You can’t use any action with the <<tag Move>>trait. 

If you’re immobilized by something holding you in place and an external force would move you out of your space, the force must succeed at a check against either the DC of the effect holding you in place or the relevant defense (usually [[Fortitude]] DC) of the monster holding you in place.
