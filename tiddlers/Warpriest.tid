You have trained in the more militant doctrine of your church, focusing on both spells and battle.

''First Doctrine'' (1st): You’re trained in light and medium armor, and you have expert proficiency in [[Fortitude]] saves. You gain the [[Shield Block]] general feat, a reaction to reduce damage with a shield. If your deity’s weapon is simple, you gain the [[Deadly Simplicity]] cleric feat.

At 13th level, if you gain the [[Divine Defense]] class feature, you also gain expert proficiency in light and medium armor.

''Second Doctrine'' (3rd): You’re trained in martial weapons.

''Third Doctrine'' (7th): You gain expert proficiency with your deity’s favored weapon. When you critically succeed at an attack roll using that weapon, you apply the weapon’s [[Critical Specialization Effect]]; use your divine spell DC if necessary.

''Fourth Doctrine'' (11th Level): Your proficiency ranks for divine spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to expert.

''Fifth Doctrine'' (15th Level): Your proficiency rank for [[Fortitude]] saves increases to master. When you roll a success at a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead.

''Final Doctrine'' (19th Level): Your proficiency ranks for divine spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to master.
