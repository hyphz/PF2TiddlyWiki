{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

You channel negative energy to harm the living or heal the undead. 

If the target is a living creature, you deal 1d8 negative damage to it, and it gets a basic [[Fortitude]] save.

If the target is a willing <<tag Undead>>creature, you restore that amount of Hit Points. 

The number of actions you spend when Casting this Spell determines its targets, range, area, and other parameters.

{{OneAction}} (somatic) The spell has a range of touch.

{{TwoAction}} (verbal, somatic) The spell has a range of 30 feet. If youâ€™re healing an undead creature, increase the Hit Points restored by 8.

{{ThreeAction}} (material, verbal, somatic) You disperse __negative__ energy in a 30-foot [[Emanation]]. This targets all living and undead creatures in the area.

Heightened (+1) The amount of healing or damage increases by 1d8, and the extra healing for the 2 action version increases by 8.
