Upon reaching 18th level, these feats make you a master in spell attack rolls and DCs of the appropriate magical tradition and grant you a 7th-level spell slot. 

At 20th level, they grant you an 8th-level spell slot. 

__If you have a spell repertoire, you can select a third spell from your repertoire as a signature spell.__
