Ammunition: Any.

Monster hunters favor bane ammunition that contains a capsule of reagents tailored to a particular type of creatureâ€” aberration, animal, beast, dragon, fey, giant, ooze, or both fungus and plant. Each type requires a different formula.

When activated ({{OneAction}} [[Interact]]) bane ammunition hits a target that has a trait matching the selected type, it takes persistent poison damage in addition to the damage the attack normally deals.

| Lesser | 1 | 30 | 1d4 |
| Moderate | 5 | 250 | 2d6 |
| Greater | 11 | 2500 | 3d6 |
