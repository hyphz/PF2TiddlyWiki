title: Knockback Strike
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

You focus your strength into a blow powerful enough to push an enemy away from you. 

Make an unarmed [[Strike]]. 

If you hit, attempt an [[Athletics]] check to [[Shove]] the target. This attack uses the same [[Multiple Attack Penalty]] as your Strike, and doesnâ€™t count toward your multiple attack penalty.
