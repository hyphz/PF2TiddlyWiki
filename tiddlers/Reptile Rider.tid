To you, crocodilians, giant lizards, and dinosaurs are loyal steeds, not monsters.

You gain the [[Ride]] feat, even if you donâ€™t meet the prerequisites. 

You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [[Nature]] checks to [[Handle an Animal]] as long as the animal is a reptile, dinosaur, or even a non-sapient dragon.
