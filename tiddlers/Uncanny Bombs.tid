''Prerequisite'' [[Far Lobber]].

You lob bombs unerringly, despite obstructions or distance.

When you throw an alchemical item with the <<tag Bomb>> trait, its [[Range Increment]] increases to 60 feet, you reduce any circumstance bonus to the targetâ€™s [[AC]] from cover by 1, and you automatically succeed at the flat check when targeting a [[Concealed]] creature.
