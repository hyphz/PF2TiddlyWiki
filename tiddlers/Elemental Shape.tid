You understand the fundamental elements of nature such that you can imbue them into your body and manifest as a living embodiment of those elements. 

Add the forms in [[Elemental Form]] to your [[Wild Shape]] list. 

Whenever youâ€™re polymorphed into another form using wild shape, you gain resistance 5 to fire.
