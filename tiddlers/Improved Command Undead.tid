Undead creatures find it all but impossible to resist your commands. 

When you use [[Command Undead]], if the undead succeeds at its save but doesnâ€™t critically succeed, it is your [[Minion]] for 1 round. 

If the undead fails its save, it is your minion for 10 minutes. 

If it critically fails, it is your minion for 24 hours.
