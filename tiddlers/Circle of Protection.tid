{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

You ward a creature and those nearby against a specified alignment. 

Choose <<tag Chaotic>>, <<tag Evil>>, <<tag Good>>, or <<tag Lawful>>; this spell gains the opposing trait. 

Creatures in the area gain a +1 status bonus to [[AC]] against attacks by creatures of the chosen alignment and to saves against effects from such creatures. 

This bonus increases to +3 against effects from such creatures that directly control the target and attacks made by summoned creatures of the chosen alignment. 

Summoned creatures of the chosen alignment canâ€™t willingly enter the area without succeeding at a [[Will]] save; repeated attempts use the first save result.

''Heightened (4th)'' The duration increases to 1 hour.
