type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

You create a snare that catalyzes three 3rd-level moderate alchemical bombs of the same type to explode when a creature enters the snareâ€™s square. 

The target and all creatures in adjacent squares must attempt a DC 26 [[Reflex]] save, as the snare deals damage equal to three times the direct hit damage from one of the component bombs (for example, 6d6 electricity damage from [[Bottled Lightning]]) with no splash damage or other effects.

''Craft Requirements'' Supply three of the same damaging 3rd-level moderate alchemical bomb.
