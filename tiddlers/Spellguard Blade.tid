The guard of this [[+1|Weapon Potency]] [[Striking]] main-gauche is inscribed with eldritch glyphs that guard against magic. 

When you are benefiting from the +1 circumstance bonus to AC from this weaponâ€™s [[Parry]] trait, you also apply that circumstance bonus to your saving throws against spells that target you.
