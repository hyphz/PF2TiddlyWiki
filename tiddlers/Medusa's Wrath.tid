title: Medusa's Wrath
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

You make an attack filled with a medusa’s petrifying power.

Make an unarmed [[Strike]].

//If you hit, the target is [[Slowed]] 1 and// must attempt a [[Fortitude]] save at the end of each of its turns; this ongoing save has the <<tag Incapacitation>> trait. ''//(This means that enemies of level higher than double the spell's level promote their save results.)//''

On a failed save, the slowed condition increases by 1 (2 on a critical failure). A successful save reduces the slowed condition by 1. 

When a creature is unable to act due to the slowed condition from medusa’s wrath, it is [[Petrified]] permanently. 

The spell ends if the creature is petrified or the slowed condition is removed.

//If your unarmed Strike is a critical hit, the target begins Slowed 2.//
