''Requirements'' You and an adjacent creature are both on a narrow surface or uneven ground and the other creature is [[Flat-Footed]].

You shuffle your feet to dislodge the surface beneath you or otherwise cause your opponent to become unsteady.

Attempt an [[Acrobatics]] check against the adjacent creatureâ€™s [[Reflex]] saving throw DC. On a success, the creature falls. On a critical failure, you fall.
