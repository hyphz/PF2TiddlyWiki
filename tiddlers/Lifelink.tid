If your familiar would be reduced to 0 HP by damage, as a [[Reaction]] with the <<tag Concentrate>> trait, you can take the damage. If you do, you take all the damage and your familiar takes none. 

However, special effects when a hit damages your familiar (such as snake venom) still apply to your familiar.
