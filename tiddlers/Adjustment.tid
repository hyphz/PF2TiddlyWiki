title: Adjustment
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Items with this trait are intended to alter existing pieces of equipment: typically armor, shields,
and weapons. The itemâ€™s description notes which type of equipment it modifies. 

An adjustment that modifies armor can modify unarmored defense attire only if specified in its description. 

A piece of equipment can have one adjustment at a time unless noted otherwise. 

Adding or removing an adjustment normally requires using a 10-minute activity and a repair kit.
