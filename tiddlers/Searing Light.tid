{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

You shoot a blazing ray of light tinged with holy energy. 

Make a ranged spell attack. 

The ray deals 5d6 <<tag Fire>>damage. If the target is a <<tag Fiend>>or <<tag Undead>>, you deal an extra 5d6 <<tag Good>>damage.

On a critical hit, the target takes double fire damage, as well as double good damage if a fiend or undead.

If the light passes through an area of magical darkness or targets a creature affected by magical darkness, searing light attempts to [[Counteract]] the darkness. 

If you need to determine whether the light passes through an area of darkness, draw a line between yourself and the spellâ€™s target.

''Heightened (+1)'' The fire damage increases by 2d6, and the good damage against fiends and undead increases by 2d6.
