''Trigger'' An enemy damages the monster’s ally, and both are within 15 feet of the monster. 

The ally gains [[Resistance]] to all damage against the triggering damage equal to 2 + the monster’s level. 

If the foe is within reach, the monster makes a melee [[Strike]] against it.

When you gain the Divine Smite ability, if you hit, the target takes persistent good damage equal to your [[Charisma]] modifier.

When you gain the Exalt ability, when you use Retributive Strike, each ally within 15 feet of you with the target in their melee reach can spend a reaction to [[Strike]] the target with a –5 penalty.
