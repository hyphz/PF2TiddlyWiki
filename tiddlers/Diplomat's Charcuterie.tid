title: Diplomat's Charcuterie
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

A common sight at political gatherings, a diplomatâ€™s charcuterie has fine meats, cheeses, nuts, fruits, and other finger foods mixed with reagents to engender friendly feelings between those consuming them. 

After Activating the charcuterie by eating it ({{ClockIcon}} 10 minutes [[Interact]]), you gain a +1 item bonus to [[Diplomacy]] checks to [[Make an Impression]] and [[Perception]] checks to [[Sense Motive]]. 

These bonuses last 24 hours or until you make your next daily preparations, whichever comes first.
