type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

You trample your foes as you charge past them. 

When you use Barreling Charge and successfully move through a creatureâ€™s space, that creature takes bludgeoning damage equal to your [[Strength]] modifier. 

If you critically succeed, the creature takes twice this amount of damage and becomes [[Flat-Footed]] until the end of your next turn.
