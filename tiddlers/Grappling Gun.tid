This wooden, pistol-like device features a large reel coiled with 100 feet of thin metal cord and can fire a grappling hook up to 100 feet. 

To reload the grappling gun, you must manually recoil the cord by turning the reelâ€™s crank, and then lock in the grappling hook. Reloading a grappling gun takes 1 minute.

//Clockwork Grappling Gun:// Clockwork controls the reel on this grappling gun, reeling the grappling hook back in when you pull a lever. Reloading a clockwork grappling gun takes three [[Interact]] actions.
