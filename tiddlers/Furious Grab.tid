''Requirements'' Your last action was a successful [[Strike]], and either you have a hand free or your Strike used a grapple weapon.

You grab your foe while itâ€™s distracted by your attack. 

The foe you hit becomes [[Grabbed]], as if you had succeeded at an [[Athletics]] check to [[Grapple]] the foe.
