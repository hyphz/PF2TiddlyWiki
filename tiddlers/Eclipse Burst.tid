{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

A globe of freezing darkness explodes in the area, dealing 8d10 cold damage to creatures and objects in the area, plus 8d4 additional negative damage to living creatures. 

Creatures and objects in the area must attempt a //basic// Reflex save. //On a critical failure, creatures are also [[Blinded]] by the darkness for an unlimited duration.//

If the globe overlaps with an area of magical <<tag Light>>or affects a creature affected by magical light, eclipse burst attempts to [[Counteract]] the light effect.

''Heightened (+1)'' The cold damage increases by 1d10 and the negative damage against the living increases by 1d4.
