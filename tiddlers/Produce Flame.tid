{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

A small ball of flame appears in the palm of your hand, and you lash out with it either in melee or at range. 

Make a spell attack roll against your targetâ€™s AC. 

This is normally a ranged attack, but you can also make a melee attack against a creature in your unarmed reach. 

On a success, you deal 1d4 <<tag Fire>>damage plus your spellcasting ability modifier. 

On a critical success, the target takes double damage and 1d4 [[persistent|Persistent Damage]] <<tag Fire>>damage.

''Heightened (+1)'' Increase the damage by 1d4 and the persistent damage on a critical hit by 1d4.
