You launch yourself at a foe. 

Make a [[Leap]] or attempt a [[High Jump]] or [[Long Jump]]. 

At the end of the jump, if youâ€™re adjacent to a foe, you can immediately [[Strike]] that foe with an unarmed attack, even if the foe is in mid-air. 

You fall to the ground after the Strike. If the distance you fall is no more than the height of
your jump, you land upright and take no damage.
