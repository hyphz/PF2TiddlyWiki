You have learned to exploit your enemiesâ€™ lowered defenses.

When you succeed or critically succeed at a [[Strike]] using your [[Strength]] modifier on the attack roll and you would deal [[Sneak Attack]] damage, you can change the additional damage from sneak attack into ordinary damage of the same type as your Strike, rather than precision damage.
