title: Brutal Critical
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Your critical hits are particularly devastating. 

On a critical hit __with a melee Strike__, add one extra damage die. 

This is in addition to any extra dice you gain if the weapon is [[Deadly]] or [[Fatal]]. 

The target also takes persistent bleed damage equal to two damage dice.
