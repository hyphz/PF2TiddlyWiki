''Requirements'' You are in [[Mountain Stance]].

You stomp, shaking the earth beneath you. 

Creatures on the ground within a 20-foot [[Emanation]] take damage equal to your Strength modifier (minimum 0), which they can resist with a basic [[Fortitude]] save __against your class DC__. 

On a failure, they also fall prone. 

After you use this action, you canâ€™t use it again for 1d4 rounds.

''Special'' If you have this feat, the [[Dexterity]] modifier cap to your AC while using Mountain Stance increases from +1 to +2.
