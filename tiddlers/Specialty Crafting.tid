type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

''Prerequisites'' Trained in [[Crafting]].

Your training focused on Crafting one particular kind of item.

Select one of the specialties listed below; you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Crafting checks to [[Craft]] items of that type.  If you are a master in Crafting, this bonus increases to +2.

If itâ€™s unclear whether the specialty applies, the GM decides.

Some specialties might apply only partially. For example, if you were making a morningstar and had specialty in woodworking, the GM might give you half your bonus because the item requires both blacksmithing and woodworking.
