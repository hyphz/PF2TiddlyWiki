''Usage'' etched onto medium or heavy armor.

A fortification rune wards against the most deadly attacks.

Each time youâ€™re critically hit while wearing the etched armor, attempt a flat check. On a success, it becomes a normal hit. 

This property thickens the armor, increasing its Bulk by 1 and the Strength required to reduce its penalties by 2.
