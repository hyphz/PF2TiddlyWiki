{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

Drawing your hand in a sweeping gesture, you shroud the target in a veil of night. The targetâ€™s eyes are blanketed in darkness. 

If you cast this hex on a [[Willing]] ally (for instance, one with light blindness), the ally can choose which result it gets without rolling. 

Regardless of the outcome, the target is then temporarily immune for 1 minute.
