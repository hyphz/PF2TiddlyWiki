//Implied by [[Call and Response]].//

While the spell is active, one ally affected by the spell can respond to your call as a single action that has the Auditory and Concentrate traits to extend the spell’s duration by 1 round. Only one ally can respond to a given call, and responding to the ally’s response has no additional effect.
