You cast spells like a [[Magus]], gaining a spellbook with four common arcane cantrips of your choice. 

You gain the [[Cast a Spell]] activity. 

You can prepare two cantrips each day from your spellbook. 

Each time you gain a spell slot of a new level from the magus archetype, add a spell of that level or lower to your spellbook. 

Youâ€™re trained in arcane spell attack rolls and spell DCs. 

Your key spellcasting ability for magus archetype spells is [[Intelligence]], and they are arcane
magus spells. 

You become trained in [[Arcana]]; if you were already trained in Arcana, you instead become trained in a skill of your choice.

You become trained in simple weapons.
