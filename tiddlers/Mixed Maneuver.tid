type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

You combine two different maneuvers together into a single flowing whole. 

Choose any two of [[Grapple]], [[Shove]], and [[Trip]]. 

Attempt both of the attacks you chose against the same or different creatures, but donâ€™t apply the [[Multiple Attack Penalty]] until after resolving both attacks.
