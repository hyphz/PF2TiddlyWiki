The extent of the corruption within you does more than simply sap your foesâ€™ strength, it devastates their minds and reflexes. 

When you use Cruelty, choose whether you want to make the creature [[Enfeebled]] as normal, to make it [[Clumsy]] 1 on a failed save (clumsy 2 on a critical failure), or to make it [[Stupefied]] 1 on a failed save (stupefied 2 on a critical failure).
