You affix a trip line or other trigger to a group of either stones or wooden stakes to strike a creature that enters the snareâ€™s square. 

The creature must attempt a DC 26 basic [[Reflex]] saving throw. If you choose stones, the snare deals 9d8 bludgeoning damage; if you choose spikes, it deals 9d8 piercing damage.
