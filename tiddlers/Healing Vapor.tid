Healing vapor is a substance that accelerates natural recovery processes by dispersing a mist infused with a variety of reagents typically used for healing and recovery.

When deployed from a sealed container ({{ThreeAction}} [[Interact]]), the vapors fill a 5-foot [[Burst]], last for 10 minutes, and can affect up to four living creatures at one time. Any creatures beyond the first four gain no benefit, though if a creature leaves before the duration is over, a new creature that enters can benefit from the mist. 

A creature benefiting from the vapors regains a number of Hit Points based on the vaporâ€™s type. While affected, a creature also gains an item bonus to saving throws against <<tag Disease>>s and <<tag Poison>>s. 

If the areas of more than one healing vapor overlap, only the strongest applies to creatures inside overlapping areas. 

Strong wind disperses the mist, rendering it ineffective while the wind blows.
