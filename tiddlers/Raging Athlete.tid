''Prerequisites'' expert in [[Athletics]].

Physical obstacles canâ€™t hold back your fury. 

While you are raging, you gain a climb Speed and swim Speed equal to your land Speed and the DC of [[High Jump]]s and [[Long Jump]]s decreases by 10.

__Your distance for a vertical [[Leap]] increases to 5 feet vertically, and your distance for a horizontal [[Leap]] increases to 15 feet if your Speed is at least 15 feet and to 20 feet if your Speed is at least 30 feet.__
