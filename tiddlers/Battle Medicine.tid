''Prerequisites'' Trained in [[Medicine]].

You can patch up yourself or an adjacent ally, even in combat.

Attempt a Medicine check with the same DC as for [[Treat Wounds]] and provide the corresponding amount of healing.

As with Treat Wounds, you can attempt checks against higher DCs if you have the minimum proficiency rank. 

The target is then temporarily immune to your Battle Medicine for 1 day.
