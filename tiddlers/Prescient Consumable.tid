''Prerequisites'' [[Prescient Planner]].

You can predict which consumables you might need in advance.

When using Prescient Planner, you can procure a consumable item from your backpack, instead of a piece of adventuring gear. 

The consumable item must still be <<tag Common>>with a level no higher than half your level, and its [[Bulk]] must be low enough that carrying it wouldnâ€™t have made you [[Encumbered]].
