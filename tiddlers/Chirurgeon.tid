You concentrate on healing others with alchemy.

''Level 1'': You start with the formulas for two of the following in your formula book, in addition to your other formulas: lesser [[Antidote]], lesser [[Antiplague]], or __minor__ [[Elixir of Life]].

''Level 1'': As long as your proficiency rank in [[Medicine]] is trained or better, you can attempt a [[Crafting]] check instead of a Medicine check for any of Medicineâ€™s untrained and trained uses.

''Level 5'': When using [[Advanced Alchemy]] to make elixirs of life during your daily preparations, you can create three elixirs with each batch of reagents instead of two.

''Level 13'': When you use [[Quick Alchemy]] to create any type of elixir of life, the creature drinking the elixir gains the maximum Hit Points possible for that elixir, instead of rolling to determine the number of Hit Points regained.
