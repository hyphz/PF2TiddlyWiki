title: Oil of Potency
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

When you apply this thick, viscous oil to a non-magical weapon or suit of armor, that item immediately becomes magically potent. 

If the item is a weapon, it temporarily becomes a [[+1|Weapon Potency]] [[Striking]] weapon, or, if itâ€™s armor, it temporarily becomes [[+1|Armor Potency]] [[Resilient]] armor. 

This lasts for 1 minute.
