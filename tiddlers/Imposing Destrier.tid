''Prerequisites'' [[Divine Ally]] (steed).

Under your care, your mount has realized its innate potential.

The mount you gained through the divine ally class feature is now a nimble or savage animal companion. 

During an encounter, even if you donâ€™t use the [[Command an Animal]] action, your mount can still use 1 action on your turn to Stride or Strike.
