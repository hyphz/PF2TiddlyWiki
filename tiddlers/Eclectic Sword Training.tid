You were always taught that you needed to be able to use whatever weapon came your way. 

You can change any of the swords designated in your [[Tengu Weapon Familiarity]] to different swords that meet the same specifications. 

You have to practice with a sword during your daily preparations to designate it, and the designation only lasts until your next daily preparations. 

This changes only your proficiency; it doesnâ€™t change your access.
