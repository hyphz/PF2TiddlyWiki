You gain access to the butterfly swordâ€™s critical specialization effect. If you already had access to the critical specialization effect or you gain the effect at a later time, you also gain the critical specialization effect for knives when you critically hit with a butterfly sword. 

You can benefit from only one critical specialization effect at a time.
