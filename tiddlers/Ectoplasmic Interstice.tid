{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

You force the Material and Ethereal Planes to partially overlap, creating a zone that causes incorporeal and spiritual entities to take on many of the aspects of corporeal creatures. 

Within the ectoplasmic interstice, [[Incorporeal]] creatures cannot pass through solid objects or corporeal creatures, and they can manipulate and attempt [[Strength]]-based checks against physical creatures and objects. 

An incorporeal PC or other creature with a normal [[Strength]] modifier simply uses that modifier, but if the creature had a Strength modifier of â€“5, like most incorporeal monsters, it uses a +4 modifier instead, increasing its [[Athletics]] modifier by 9 accordingly. 

Attacks against creatures that are within the interstice overcome resistances as if they were by [[Ghost Touch]] weapons.
