{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

You strike mention of a specific name from one or more documents. 

When you cast the spell, give one proper name, be it a creature, location, or object. Any mention of that name within the document becomes blurred, smudged, or otherwise completely illegible. 

Epithets and unambiguous references to the name are redacted as well; for instance, redacting the name of //a goddess// from a book would also remove references to her title.

''Heightened (3rd)'' Instead of striking out a given name, you can replace it with a different name you choose. Epithets and references are substituted with similar ones relating to the replacement name. Anyone reading the text can attempt a [[Perception]] or [[Society]] check against your spell DC to notice the altered text, though that doesnâ€™t tell them what the original said.

''Heightened (4th)'' At your choice, the duration is unlimited.
