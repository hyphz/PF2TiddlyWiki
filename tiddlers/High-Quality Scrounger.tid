When you Craft a temporary item using Scrounger Dedication, it can be an item of up to 3rd level (though the item must still be a weapon, armor, or a nonconsumable piece of adventuring gear). 

You can instead Craft it for someone elseâ€™s use, allowing them to avoid taking the penalty for using a shoddy item when using it, but causing you to take the penalty if you use it.
