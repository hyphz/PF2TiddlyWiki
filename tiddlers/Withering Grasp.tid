{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

Your touch rots organic material and decays objects. 

Make a melee spell attack roll. 

Your touch deals 1d12 <<tag Negative>> damage plus 1d4 [[persistent|Persistent Damage]] negative damage. 

If a creature uses an item to block withering grasp, such as with the [[Shield Block]] reaction, the item is automatically affected, but the creature does not take damage (even if there is damage left over after the shieldâ€™s Hardness). 

Unlike normal negative damage, the negative damage from withering grasp damages objects, constructs, and the like by eroding them away. If you target an object, lower its Hardness by 2 for 1 minute.

//If the spell attack is a critical success,// your touch deals double damage (both initial and persistent). If you target an object, lower its Hardness by 4 for 1 minute.

''Heightened (+1)'' The damage increases by 1d12 and the persistent damage increases by 1. If you target an object, lower its Hardness by an additional 1 point on both a success and a critical success.
