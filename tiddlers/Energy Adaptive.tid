''Usage'' etched onto armor

A complex pattern of protective symbols gives protection against various forms of energy, but only part of the runic structure can be active at a given time.

''Activate'' {{ReactionIcon}} <<tag Envision>>; ''Frequency'' once per hour; ''Trigger'' You take <<tag Acid>>, <<tag Cold>>, <<tag Electricity>>, or <<tag Fire>> damage; ''Effect'' You gain resistance 5 to the triggering damage type. This doesnâ€™t apply to the triggering damage. This resistance lasts until you Activate this rune again or the armor is no longer invested by you.
