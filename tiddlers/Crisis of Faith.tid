{{||SpellSummaryTable}}
You assault the targetâ€™s faith, riddling the creature with doubt and mental turmoil that deal 6d6 mental damage, or 6d8 mental damage if it can cast divine spells. 

The effects are determined by its [[Will]] save.

To many deities, casting this spell on a follower of your own deity without significant cause is [[Anathema]].

''Heightened (+1)'' The damage increases by 2d6 (or by 2d8 if the target is a divine spellcaster).
