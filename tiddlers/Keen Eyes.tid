Your eyes are sharp, allowing you to make out small details about concealed or even invisible creatures that others might miss. 

You gain a +2 circumstance bonus when using the [[Seek]] action to find [[Hidden]] or [[Undetected]] creatures within 30 feet of you. 

When you target an opponent that is [[Concealed]] from you or [[Hidden]] from you, reduce the DC of the flat check to 3 for a concealed target or 9 for a hidden one.
