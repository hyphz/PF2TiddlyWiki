{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

You accelerate the processes of decay in the area. 

Each living creature in the area takes 2d10 negative damage (basic [[Fortitude]] save). 

A creature afflicted by a disease takes a â€“2 circumstance penalty to this save.

You can also direct the blight to rot all Small and Tiny non-creature plants in the area, eliminating non-magical undergrowth and any resulting [[Difficult Terrain]], [[Cover]], and [[Concealment]]. 

Sudden blight attempts to [[Counteract]] any magical effect on the plants before withering them.

''Heightened (+1)'' The damage increases by 1d10.
