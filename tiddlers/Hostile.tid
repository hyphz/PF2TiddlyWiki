__This condition reflects a creature’s disposition toward a particular character, and only supernatural effects (like a spell) can impose these conditions on player characters.__

A creature that is hostile to a character actively seeks to harm that character. 

It doesn’t necessarily attack, but it won’t accept [[Request]]s from the character.
