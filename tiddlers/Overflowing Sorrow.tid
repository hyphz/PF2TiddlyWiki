{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

Sadness flows out of you into nearby creatures, blotting out any other thoughts they had. 

The first time a creature begins its turn in the area or enters the area, it must attempt a [[Will]] save. If it later leaves and reenters the area, it uses the same effect as before.

''Heightened (+2)'' When you Cast the Spell, you can choose to increase the area by 5 feet.
