title: Infused Reagents
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

You infuse reagents with your own alchemical essence, allowing you to create alchemical items at no cost. 

Each day during your [[daily preparations|Rest]], you gain a number of batches of infused reagents equal to your level + your Intelligence modifier. 

You can use these reagents for either advanced alchemy or [[Quick Alchemy]].

Together, these infused reagents have light [[Bulk]].

As soon as you make your next daily preparations, your infused reagents from the previous day’s preparations are instantly destroyed, and nonpermanent effects of your previous day’s infused items immediately end. 

While infused reagents are physical objects, they can’t be duplicated, preserved, or created in any way other than your daily preparations. Any such artificial reagents lack the infusion and are useless for advanced alchemy or Quick Alchemy.
