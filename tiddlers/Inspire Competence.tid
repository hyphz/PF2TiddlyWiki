''Prerequisite'' [[Maestro Muse]].

Your encouragement inspires your ally to succeed at a task.

This counts as having taken sufficient preparatory actions to [[Aid]] your ally on a skill check of your choice, regardless of the circumstances. 

When you later use the Aid reaction, you can roll [[Performane]] instead of the normal skill check, and if you roll a failure, you get a success instead. 

If you are legendary in Performance, you automatically critically succeed.

The GM might rule that you canâ€™t use this ability if the act of encouraging your ally would interfere with the skill check (such as a check to [[Sneak]] quietly or maintain a disguise).
