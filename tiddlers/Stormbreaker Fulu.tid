tags: Consumable Item Fulu Magical Uncommon Abjuration Talisman Command
title: Stormbreaker Fulu
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

''Usage'' affixed to armor.

''Activate'' {{FreeAction}} Command. ''Trigger'': You would be forced to move, you would be teleported, or you would take <<tag Cold>>, <<tag Electricity>>, or <<tag Sonic>> damage.

This unassuming paper tag is inscribed with magical symbols. 

When you activate the fulu, it vanishes in a wisp of cloud, and you gain [[Resistance]] 15 to cold, electricity, and sonic damage until the end of your next turn. 

For that duration, you ignore [[Difficult Terrain]] from wind and weather, and you canâ€™t be forcibly moved or teleported unless the effect [[Counteract]]s the fulu (DC 40). 

These protections apply against the triggering effect.
