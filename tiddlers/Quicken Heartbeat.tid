''Frequency'' once per turn

Youâ€™ve replaced your heart with one made of animated quicksilver and living adamantine. 

You reduce your [[Slowed]] condition by 1. 

Alternatively, if you are not slowed, you are [[Quickened]] 1 during your next turn, and can use your extra action to [[Stride]] or [[Strike]].
