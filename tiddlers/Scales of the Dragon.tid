Scales grow across your body, protecting you against physical and magical threats. 

When youâ€™re unarmored, the scales give you a +2 status bonus to AC with a Dexterity cap of __+3__.

__The item bonus to AC from Scales of the Dragon is cumulative with armor potency runes on your explorer's clothing, [[Mage Armor]], and [[Bracers of Armor]].__

Your resistance from Dragon Disciple Dedication increases to 3 + half your level.
