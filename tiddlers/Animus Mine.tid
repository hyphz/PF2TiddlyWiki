{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

You implant a mental mine within your psyche that detonates against anyone attempting to manipulate your thoughts. 

You can use a single action, which has the <<tag Concentrate>> trait, to suppress the effects of the mine for 1 round to allow someone to safely use a <<tag Mental>> effect on you. 

You can [[Dismiss]] the spell.

The first creature that uses a mental effect against you triggers the animus mine, causing the spell to end. The animus mine deals 4d8 mental damage to the triggering creature, which must attempt a [[Will]] save.

__The animus mine spell should only the deal the mental damage on magical mental effects that send their magic into your mind, not if a creature tries to do something mundane like talk to you.__

''Heightened (+1)'' The damage increases by 2d8.
