title: Spring from the Shadows
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Leaping out from hiding, you assail your target when they least expect it. 

You [[Stride]] up to your Speed, but you must end your movement next to an enemy youâ€™re [[Hidden]] from or [[Undetected]] by. 

You then [[Strike]] that enemy; you remain [[Hidden]] from or [[Undetected]] by that creature until after you Strike. 

You can use Spring from the Shadows while Burrowing, Climbing, Flying, or Swimming instead of Striding if you have the corresponding movement type.
