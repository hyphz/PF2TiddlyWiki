''Requirements'' You are wielding a ranged or thrown weapon that deals piercing damage.

Your projectiles are unhindered by flesh and bone. 

Make a ranged [[Strike]] against each creature in a 30-foot line. 

These attacks ignore lesser cover, [[Cover]], and greater cover granted by creatures. 

Roll damage only once and apply it to each creature you hit. 

Each attack counts toward your [[Multiple Attack Penalty]], but donâ€™t increase your penalty until you have made all your attacks.
