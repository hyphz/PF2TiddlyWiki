title: Release
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

You release something youâ€™re holding in your hand or hands. 

This might mean dropping an item, removing one hand from your weapon while continuing to hold it in another hand,  releasing a rope suspending a chandelier, or performing a similar action. 

Unlike most manipulate actions, Release does not trigger reactions that can be triggered by actions with the manipulate trait (such as [[Attack of Opportunity]]). If you want to prepare to Release something outside of your turn, use the [[Ready]] activity.
