{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

''Requirements'' Youâ€™re wielding a melee weapon in two hands.

You swing your massive weapon, creating a wave of sonic vibrations that topples creatures. 

Make a melee [[Strike]] with your two-handed weapon. Each creature in a 15-foot cone from you must attempt a basic [[Fortitude]] save against your spell DC or take 2 sonic damage. 

On a critical failure, the creature is knocked prone. 

The target of your Strike must be within the cone or the effect fails.

''Heightened (+1)'' The damage increases by 1.
