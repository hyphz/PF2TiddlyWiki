''Trigger'' You attempt a saving throw against a spell or magical effect, but havenâ€™t rolled yet.

You notice spirits that inhabit objects, learning which bring good fortune and which are unlucky. 

You focus on the power of a lucky object, granting you a +1 circumstance bonus to your saving throw against the triggering effect.
