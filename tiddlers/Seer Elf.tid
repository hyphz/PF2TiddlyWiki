You have an inborn ability to detect and understand magical phenomena. You can cast the [[Detect Magic]] cantrip as an arcane innate spell at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up. In addition, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to checks to [[Identify Magic]] and to [[Decipher Writing]] of a magical nature. These skill actions typically use the [[Arcana]], [[Nature]], [[Occultism]], or [[Religion]] skill.
