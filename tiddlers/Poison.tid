Poisons are a form of [[Affliction]].

Unlike other forms of Affliction, poison has an effect if you are re-exposed to the same poison while already under its effects. Failing a save against a re-exposure increases the stage by 1, or 2 on a critical failure. It does not extend the maximum duration.
