{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

You conjure a temporary simple tool, such as a shovel or rope into your hands. 

It lasts until it is used for a single activity or for 1 minute, whichever comes first, after which it disappears. 

The tool is obviously temporarily conjured, and thus canâ€™t be sold or passed off as a genuine item.

//The book lists no components for this spell, but it is unlikely to be used in encounter mode.//
