title: Tusks (Half-Orc)
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Most half-orcs have visible tusks, but yours are particularly large and sharp, capable of gouging deep wounds. 

You gain a jaws unarmed attack that deals 1d6 piercing damage.

''Special'' You can take this feat only at 1st level, and you canâ€™t retrain out of this feat or into this feat.

//This feat is probably a misprint, since a Half-Orc can take the [[Tusks (Orc)]] feat which gives a similar effect but more precisely specified.//
