You go to extreme lengths to support your allies, even when it means bringing harm to yourself. 

If your next action is to cast [[Harm]] or [[Heal]] from your healing or harmful font to restore Hit Points to a single ally, you can channel your own vitality along with the spell. 

You lose 1d8 Hit Points per level of the spell, which canâ€™t be reduced or mitigated in any way, and your ally regains an equal number of Hit Points.
