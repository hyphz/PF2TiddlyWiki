When you use [[Fascinating Performance]] in a combat encounter, you need only a success, rather than a critical success, to fascinate your target. 

This works only if youâ€™re attempting to fascinate one target. For example, if you were an expert in Performance, you could choose to target multiple creatures normally or target one creature and fascinate it on a success.
