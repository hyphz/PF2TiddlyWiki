In an encounter, if you donâ€™t Command your familiar, it still gains 1 action each round. 

Typically, you still decide how it spends that action, but the GM might determine that your familiar chooses its own tactics rather than performing your preferred action.

__This doesn't work with [[Valet]] or similar abilities that require a command, if you're capable of riding your familiar, or similar situations.__
