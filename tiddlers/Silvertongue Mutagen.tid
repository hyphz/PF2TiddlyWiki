Your features become striking and your voice becomes musical and commanding, though facts and figures become hazy for you and emotion clouds your ability to reason.

''Benefit'' You gain an item bonus to [[Deception]], [[Diplomacy]], [[Intimidation]], and [[Performance]] checks. Your critical failures with any of these skills become failures instead.

''Drawback'' You take a â€“2 item penalty to [[Arcana]], [[Crafting]], [[Lore]], [[Occultism]], and [[Society]] checks. Choose one skill in which you are trained; for the duration, you become untrained in that skill. All your failures on checks to [[Recall Knowledge]] become critical failures.
