{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

You fire a ray of heat and flame. 

Make a spell attack roll against a single creature. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 fire damage, and on a critical hit, the target takes double damage.

//You can use between 1 and 3 actions to cast this spell.// For each action you use when Casting the Spell, you can fire a ray at a different target, to a maximum of three rays targeting three different targets for 3 actions. 

These attacks each increase your multiple attack penalty, but you donâ€™t increase your multiple attack penalty until after you make all the spell attack rolls for __Blazing Bolt__. 

If you spend 2 or more actions Casting the Spell, the damage increases to 4d6 fire damage on a hit, and it still deals double damage on a critical hit.

''Heightened (+1)'' The damage to each target increases by 1d6 for the 1-action version, or by 2d6 for the 2-action and 3-action versions.
