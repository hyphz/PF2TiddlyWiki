Your research field adds a number of formulas to your formula book; these are your signature items. 

When using a batch of infused reagents to create your signature items using [[Advanced Alchemy]], you create three items instead of two. 

Each time you gain a level, you can swap one of your signature items with another formula in your formula book. This new signature item must be on your research fieldâ€™s list of possible signature items.
