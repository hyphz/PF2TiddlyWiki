You use your medical training to ameliorate sickness or assuage fears. 

When you use [[Medicine]] to [[Administer First Aid]], instead of Stabilizing a character or Stopping Bleeding, you can reduce an allyâ€™s [[Frightened]] or [[Sickened]] condition by 2, or remove either of those conditions entirely on a critical success. 

You can remove only one condition at a time. 

The DC for the Medicine check is usually the DC of the effect that caused the condition.
