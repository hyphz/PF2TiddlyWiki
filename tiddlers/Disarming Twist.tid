type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

''Requirements'' You are wielding only a single one-handed melee weapon and have your other hand or hands free.

After your initial attack redirects your foeâ€™s defenses, your follow-up wrests their weapon from their grasp. 

Make a melee [[Strike]] with the required weapon. In addition to its other effects, this Strike gains the success and critical success effects of the [[Disarm]] action. 

The Strike also has the following failure effect: the target is [[Flat-Footed]] until the end of your current turn.
