You have a limited ability to sense life force, like your psychopomp forebears. 

You gain [[Lifesense (Sense)]] as an [[Imprecise]] sense with a range of 10 feet. 

This allows you to sense the life force within living creatures and its counterforce that animates the undead, though you canâ€™t distinguish between the two.
