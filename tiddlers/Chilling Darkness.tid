{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

You shoot an utterly cold ray of darkness tinged with unholy energy. 

Make a ranged spell attack against the target. 

You deal 5d6 cold damage, plus 5d6 evil damage if the target is a celestial.

If the ray passes through an area of magical light or targets a creature affected by magical light, chilling darkness attempts to [[Counteract]] the light. 

If you need to determine whether the ray passes through an area of light, draw a line between yourself and the spellâ€™s target.

''Heightened (+1)'' The cold damage increases by 2d6, and the evil damage against celestials increases by 2d6.
