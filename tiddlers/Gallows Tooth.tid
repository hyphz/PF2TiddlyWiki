Affix to a weapon.

''Requirements'' You're an master in [[Intimidation]].

''Trigger'' You attack an adjacent creature and haven't rolled your attack roll.

This grisly molar hangs from a cord threaded through a tiny hole just above its dried, exposed root. 

When you activate this talisman, the creature youâ€™re attacking becomes [[Flat-Footed]] until the end of the current turn.
