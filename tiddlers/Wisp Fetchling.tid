Youâ€™re Small instead of Medium. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [[Acrobatics]], the [[Quick Squeeze]] skill feat, and a +1 circumstance bonus to Acrobatics checks to [[Tumble Through]]. If you would automatically become trained in Acrobatics (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice.
