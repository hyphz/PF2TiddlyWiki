a-fumble: You become stuck in the tight space. While youâ€™re stuck, you can spend 1 minute attempting another Acrobatics check at the same DC. Any result on that check other than a critical failure causes you to become unstuck.

You contort yourself to squeeze through a space so small you can barely fit through. 

This action is for exceptionally small spaces; many tight spaces are [[Difficult Terrain]] that you can move through more quickly and without a check.
