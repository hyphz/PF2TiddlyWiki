You become trained in [[Athletics]]; if you were already trained in Athletics, you instead become trained in a skill of your choice.

You become trained in barbarian class DC.

You can use the [[Rage]] action.

Choose an Instinct as you would if you were a barbarian. You have that instinct for all purposes and become bound by its anathema, but you donâ€™t gain any of the other abilities it grants.

!! Instincts
