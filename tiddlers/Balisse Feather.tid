title: Balisse Feather
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Affix to a weapon. 

This long, fire-red feather seems to catch flame every time the weapon it adorns strikes a purveyor of evil. 

''Trigger'' You deal damage using the affixed weapon to a creature you have seen commit an evil act.

''Activate'' {{FreeAction}} Envision:  The creature you damaged burns with holy light. The creature must succeed at a DC 29 [[Will]] save or take a â€“2 status penalty to AC and saving throws and reduce its resistances by 5. These effects last until the end of your next turn.
