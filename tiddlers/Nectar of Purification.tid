title: Nectar of Purification
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

A shimmering liquid, nectar of purification is often stored in bottles similar to those used for vinegar. 

This oil casts a 1st-level [[Purify Food and Drink]] spell over any food or drink onto which itâ€™s poured. 

The nectar evaporates as it takes effect, leaving the taste and texture of the food or drink unaltered.
