type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Affix to armor.

''Requirements'' You're an expert in [[Reflex]] //saves//.

''Trigger'' You attempt to [[Grab an Edge]] but haven't rolled.

This pyramid-shaped spike is attached to an armorâ€™s chest piece. 

When you activate {{FreeAction}} the spike, it shoots a strand of force to help you gain purchase. 

If you roll a success on the triggering attempt, you get a critical success instead (if you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead).
