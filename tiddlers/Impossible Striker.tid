Your attacks are swift and deadly beyond explanation.

Nothing can prevent you from making a [[Sneak Attack]], even if your opponent can see every blow coming. 

Instead of dealing the damage from [[Sly Striker]], you can deal your full sneak attack damage to a target even if the target isnâ€™t flat-footed.
