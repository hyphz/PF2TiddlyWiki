{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

Make a melee unarmed Strike. If you hit and the target is alive, anytime during the duration, you can spend a single action, which has the <<tag Auditory>> and <<tag Concentrate>> traits, to speak a word of death that could instantly slay it. 

The target must attempt a [[Fortitude]] save.

{{||SaveSuccessTable}}

If you cast quivering palm again, the effects of any quivering palm you had previously cast end.

''Heightened (+1)'' The damage increases by 10 on a failure, or 5 on a success.
