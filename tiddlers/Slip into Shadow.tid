''Prerequisites'' ability to cast at least one spell with the <<tag Darkness>> trait

Your shadow magic bleeds into the space around you. 

Whenever you cast a spell with the darkness trait, a lingering aura of shadows reduces bright light within a 5-foot emanation around you to [[Dim Light]] until the end of your turn. 

Like in natural dim light, you can use these shadows to [[Hide]], but the aura still makes your overall position obvious, so you canâ€™t become [[Undetected]] through the use of these shadows alone.
