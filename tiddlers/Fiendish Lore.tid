You were raised by a tiefling or a fiendish relative, or youâ€™ve devoted yourself to researching the secrets of the fiendish realms. 

You gain the trained proficiency rank in [[Intimidation]] and [[Religion]]. If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. 

You also become trained in a [[Lore]] skill related to the fiendish plane from which you trace your lineage (usually Abaddon Lore, Abyss Lore, or Hell Lore).
