{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

You conjure a 5-foot-wide rain cloud that follows the target wherever it goes. It stays roughly an armâ€™s length overhead, unless it must drift lower to fit under a ceiling. The cloud rains constantly on the target, keeping it wet and dampening the ground in the wake of any movement.

The rain extinguishes non-magical flames. 

The target gains <<tag Fire>> resistance 2. 

Creatures with weakness to <<tag Water>> take damage equal to their weakness at the end of each of their turns. 

Creatures can attempt a [[Reflex]] save to avoid the cloud.

''Heightened (+1)'' The amount of fire resistance increases by 2.
