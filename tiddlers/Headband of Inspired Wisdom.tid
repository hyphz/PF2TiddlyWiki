This simple cloth headband remains pristine and clean at all times, no matter the circumstances. 

When you invest the headband, you either increase your [[Wisdom]] score by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever would give you a higher score. {{ApexLimit}}

''Activate'' {{OneAction}} envision; ''Frequency'' once per day; ''Effect'' When you are considering a course of action, you get a gut feeling about whether itâ€™s a good idea. You gain the effects of an [[Augury]] spell, except that you receive the result from your own instincts rather than an external source.

''Activate'' {{ReactionIcon}} envision (fortune); ''Frequency'' once per hour; ''Trigger'' You fail a saving throw against an effect that makes you [[Confused]], [[Fascinated]], or [[Stupefied]]; ''Effect'' The headband of inspired wisdom clears your mind. You can reroll the saving throw and use the better result.
