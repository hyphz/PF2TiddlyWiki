title: Hail of Arrows Snare
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

When a creature enters the snare’s square, it releases hundreds upon hundreds of carefully prepared arrows, blanketing a 20-foot radius around the snare’s square with massive arrow fire that deals 18d6 piercing damage. 

Creatures in the area must attempt a DC 37 basic [[Reflex]] saving throw.
