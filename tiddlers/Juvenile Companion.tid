{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

You transform your companion into its juvenile form, such as a cub, foal, kitten, puppy, or piglet, making the target appear harmless. 

It becomes Tiny (if it was larger), and its reach is reduced to 0 feet. All of its Speeds are halved (to a minimum Speed of 5 feet), and it gains [[Weakness]] 5 to physical damage. 

In all other ways, its abilities and statistics are unchanged.

If your companion uses a [[Hostile Action]], juvenile companion ends. 

This spell has no effect on a companion that doesnâ€™t have a juvenile form.

''Heightened (2nd)'' The duration increases to 1 hour.
