You were raised with an aasimar or celestial relative, or youâ€™ve devoted yourself to researching the secrets of the celestial realms. 

You gain the trained proficiency rank in [[Diplomacy]] and [[Religion]]. If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. 

You also become trained in a [[Lore]] skill related to the celestial realm from which you trace your lineage (usually Elysium Lore, Heaven Lore, or Nirvana Lore).
