title: Deadly Grace
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Your graceful attacks are especially powerful. 

When you score a critical hit with an [[Agile]] or [[Finesse]] melee weapon that has the [[Deadly]] trait, you double the number of dice from that trait. 

When you wield an agile or finesse melee weapon that doesnâ€™t have the [[Deadly]] trait, it gains the deadly d8 trait instead.
