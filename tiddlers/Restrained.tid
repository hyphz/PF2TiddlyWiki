You’re tied up and can barely move, or a creature has you pinned. 

You have the [[Flat-Footed]] and [[Immobilized]] conditions. 

You can’t use any actions with the [[Attack]] or [[Manipulate]] traits except to attempt to [[Escape]] or [[Force Open]] your bonds. 

[[Restrained]] overrides [[Grabbed]].
