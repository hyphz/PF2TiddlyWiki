title: Oil of Object Animation
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This fine golden oil comes in a small blue canister. 

Carefully spreading the oil over an object ({{TwoAction}} [[Interact]]) turns it into an animated object of the same type. For example, sprinkling it on a statue makes an animated statue. 

If the animated objectâ€™s level would be greater than 3 (Greater Oil: 11), the oil struggles to animate it and ultimately fails.

This animated object has the <<tag Minion>> trait, meaning it can use 2 actions when you Command it. You can issue a Command for the current turn as part of the activation. 

The object remains animated for 1 minute before falling inert. As usual, you can have a maximum of four minions under your control.
