''Trigger'' An ally within 30 feet gains the [[Frightened]] condition.

You serve as an anchor to your close companions, calming them in times of stress.

Decrease the value of the triggering allyâ€™s frightened condition by 1. 

The ally is then temporarily immune to your Reassuring Presence for 1 hour.
