{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

You shroud the target in a powerful predatory aura and amplify its vocalizations. 

It gains a +1 status bonus to [[Intimidation]] checks. 

Once during this spellâ€™s duration, it can take the Thundering Roar action.

''Thundering Roar'' {{OneAction}} <<Tag Auditory>> <<tag Concentrate>> <<tag Emotion>> <<tag Enchantment>> <<tag Fear>> <<tag Flourish>> <<tag Mental>> <<tag Sonic>> The target unleashes a powerful vocalization. Each enemy in a 10-foot [[Emanation]] takes 4d8 sonic damage with a basic [[Will]] save against your spell DC. A creature that fails its [[Will]] save is also [[Frightened]] 1.

''Heightened (+2)'' The status bonus to Intimidation checks increases by 1 (to a maximum of a +4 status bonus for an 8th-level spell), and the damage from the roar increases by 2d8.
