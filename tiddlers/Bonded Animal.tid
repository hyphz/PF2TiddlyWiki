''Prerequisites'' Expert in [[Nature]].

You forge strong connections with animals. 

You can spend 7 days of downtime trying to bond with a normal animal (not a companion or other special animal). 

After this duration, attempt a DC 20 [[Nature]] check. If successful, you bond with the animal. 

The animal is permanently [[Helpful]] to you, unless you do something egregious to break your bond. A helpful animal is easier to direct, as described under [[Command an Animal]].

Bonding with a new animal ends any previous bond you had.

You canâ€™t have both a bonded animal and an animal companion (though you can have both a bonded animal and a familiar).
