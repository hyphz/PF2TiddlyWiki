''Prerequisites'' Legendary in [[Society]].

Your skill with languages and codes is so great that you can decipher information with little more than a quick read through a text. 

You can [[Decipher Writing]] using Society while reading at normal speed. 

If you slow down and spend the full amount of time thatâ€™s ordinarily required and roll a success, you get a critical success; if you critically succeed while spending the normal amount of time, you gain a nearly word-for-word understanding of the document.
