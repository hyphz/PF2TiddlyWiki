{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

You alter a creatureâ€™s shadow, transforming it into a terrifying monster out to devour the creature. 

The creature must attempt a [[Will]] save. 

A creature that has the frightened condition from unspeakable shadow must spend at least one of its actions each turn to either attack its shadow (making a Strike ineffectually) or flee from its shadow (using one action to move away as though it had the [[Fleeing]] condition).
