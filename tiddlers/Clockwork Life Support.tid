Every day you must perform 10 minutes of maintenance and wind up your clockwork parts, or you risk failure of the components, with consequences depending on what you replaced (determined by you and the GM). 

Your clockwork components allow you to react to danger with alacrity. 

You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to initiative rolls.
