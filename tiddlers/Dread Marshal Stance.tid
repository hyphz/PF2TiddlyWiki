Putting on a grim face for the battle ahead, you encourage your allies to strike fear into their foes with vicious attacks.

When you use this action, attempt an [[Intimidation]] check. The DC is usually a standard difficulty DC of your level, but the GM can assign a different DC based on the circumstances. The effect depends on the result of your check.
