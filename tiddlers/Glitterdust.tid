{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

Creatures in the area are outlined by glittering dust. 

Each creature must attempt a Reflex save. 

If a creature has its invisibility negated by this spell, it is [[Concealed]] instead of [[Invisible]]. 

This applies both if the creature was already invisible and if it benefits from new invisibility effects before the end of the invisibility negation effect from this spell.
