title: Augment Senses
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

You open vestigial eyes, unfurl tympanic flaps of skin, or otherwise enhance your senses. 

Until the start of your next turn, you gain the following benefits: you canâ€™t be flanked; when you [[Seek]] for creatures, you can scan a 60-foot cone or a 30-foot burst instead of the normal area; and when you [[Seek]] for hidden objects, you can search a 15-foot square instead of the normal area.
