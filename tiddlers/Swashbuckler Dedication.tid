Choose a swashbuckler style. 

You gain the [[Panache]] class feature (page 84), and you can gain panache in all the ways a swashbuckler of your style can. 

You become trained in [[Acrobatics]] or the skill associated with your style. If you were already trained in both skills, you instead become trained in a skill of your choice.

You also become trained in swashbuckler class DC. 

You donâ€™t gain any other effects of your chosen style.
