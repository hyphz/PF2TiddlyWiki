type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Undead harmed by your positive energy might flee, compelled by an innate aversion to the
force opposite undeath. 

When you use a [[Heal]] spell to damage undead, each undead of your level or lower that critically fails its save gains the [[Fleeing]] condition for 1 round.
