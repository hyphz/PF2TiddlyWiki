{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

You harmlessly place your unique magic sigil, which is about 1 square inch in size, on your targets. 

When you Cast the Spell, you set the duration by choosing a time at which point the sigil flashes dimly three times. After that point, the spell ends. 

Even though spell durations arenâ€™t normally exact, the effects of synchronize are precise to the second. 

The timer is based on the place where the spell was cast, so entering a plane or area where time flows differently changes how the time elapses.

''Heightened (2nd)'' The spell can target up to 20 willing creatures.
