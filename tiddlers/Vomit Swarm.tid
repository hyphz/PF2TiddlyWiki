{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

You belch forth a swarm of magical vermin. You evoke and shape the creatures from your own imagination, allowing you to change the appearance of the creatures (typically a mix of centipedes, roaches, wasps, and worms), but this doesnâ€™t change the effect of the spell. 

The vermin swarm over anyone in the area, their bites and stings dealing 2d8 piercing damage (basic [[Reflex]] save). 

A creature that fails its saving throw also becomes [[Sickened]] 1. 

Once the spell ends, the swarm disappears.

''Heightened (+1)'' Increase the damage by 1d8.
