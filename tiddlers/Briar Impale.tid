//Implied by [[Impaling Briars]].//

In addition, once per round you can direct the briars to impale any target in the area (or flying up to 20 feet above the area) that you can see by using a single action, which has the Concentrate and Manipulate traits.

Make a spell attack roll. On a success, the target takes 10d6 piercing damage and takes a â€“10-foot circumstance penalty to all Speeds for 1 round; on a critical success, the target is [[Immobilized]] for 1 round unless it [[Escape]]s.
