''Prerequisites'' Expert in [[Medicine]].

You zealously monitor a patientâ€™s progress to administer treatment faster. 

When you [[Treat Wounds]], your patient becomes immune for only 10 minutes instead of 1 hour. 

This applies only to your Treat Wounds activities, not any other the patient receives.
