title: Affix a Fulu
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

You affix a fulu to an armor, weapon, shield, creature, or structure thatâ€™s beside or in the same square as you. 

A creature can remove a fulu from itself or an unattended object in its reach with a single action.

//If the fulu is also a talisman, you must attach it with [[Affix a Talisman]] rather than this action.//
