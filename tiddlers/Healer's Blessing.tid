{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

Your words bless a creature with an enhanced connection to positive energy. 

When the target regains [[Hit Points]] from a <<tag Healing>> spell, it regains __2__ additional Hit Points.

The target regains additional Hit Points from healerâ€™s blessing only the first time it regains HP from a given healing spell, so a spell that heals the creature repeatedly over a duration would restore additional Hit Points only once.

''Heightened (+1)'' The additional healing increases by 2 HP.
