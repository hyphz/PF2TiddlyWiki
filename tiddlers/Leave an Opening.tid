title: Leave an Opening
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

When you hit hard enough, you leave an opening so your ally can jump in on the action. 

Whenever you critically hit a [[Flatâ€‘Footed]] opponent with a melee attack and deal damage, the target triggers an [[Attack of Opportunity]] reaction from one ally of your choice who has that reaction, as if the enemy had used a <<tag Manipulate>> action.
