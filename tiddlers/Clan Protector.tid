Your clan dagger can protect your allies as easily as yourself. 

When you use an [[Interact]] action to gain a circumstance bonus to AC from your clan daggerâ€™s [[Parry]] trait, you can grant the circumstance bonus to an adjacent ally instead of gaining it yourself. 

You can use multiple [[Interact]] actions to protect multiple allies, or to protect yourself and an ally. The ally benefits from the bonus to AC only when they are adjacent to you.
