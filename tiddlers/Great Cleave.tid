''Prerequisite'' [[Cleave]].

Your fury carries your weapon through multiple foes. 

When you Cleave, if your Strike also kills or knocks the target unconscious, you can continue to make melee Strikes until you make a Strike that doesnâ€™t kill or knock a creature unconscious, or until there are no creatures adjacent to the most recent creature you attacked while Cleaving, whichever comes first.
