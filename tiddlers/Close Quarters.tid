Youâ€™ve trained to fight with allies in tunnel warrens, dense undergrowth, or similarly cramped terrain. 

If you are Small or smaller, you can end your movement in the same square as a Small or smaller ally. 

No more than two creatures can share the same space when using this ability or a similar one.
