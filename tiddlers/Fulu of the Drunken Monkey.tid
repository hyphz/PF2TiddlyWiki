''Activate'' {{FreeAction}} <<tag Envision>>: ''Trigger'' You attempt a [[Fortitude]] save against an ingested poison.

The monkey on this fulu sits on the point of the armor just over the bearerâ€™s stomach, happily drinking any intoxicants that come flowing down.

If the triggering poison was normal alcohol, you instead automatically succeed at the triggering save and gain a +4 status bonus on saves against alcohol for 1 minute.
