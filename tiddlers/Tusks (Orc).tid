type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

You have particularly long, jagged tusks perfect for tearing meat from bone. 

You gain a tusks unarmed attack that deals 1d6 piercing damage. Your tusks are in the brawling group and have the [[Finesse]] and [[Unarmed]] traits.

''Special'' You can take this feat only at 1st level, and you canâ€™t retrain into this feat. You can retrain out of this feat only through drastic measures such as breaking or filing your tusks.
