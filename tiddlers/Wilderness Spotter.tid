Select one type of terrain from the following list: aquatic, arctic, desert, forest, mountain, plains, sky, swamp, or underground. 

You can use [[Survival]] in place of [[Perception]] to roll initiative when in the selected terrain in a natural location (not a structure) even if you werenâ€™t tracking or otherwise using Survival before the encounter. 

You can also use [[Survival]] instead of Perception to notice traps in natural locations in the chosen terrain; if you find a snare in this way, you can also use [[Survival]] instead of [[Thievery]] to [[Disable the Device|Disable a Device]].

''Special'' You can select this feat more than once. Each time you select it, the feat applies to a new type of terrain.
