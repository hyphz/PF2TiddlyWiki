Your divine touch rejuvenates the weak and tired. 

When you use [[Mercy]], you can instead attempt a [[Counteract]] Check to remove the [[Clumsy]] or [[Enfeebled]] conditions, using the source of that condition to determine the counteract level and DC. 

If the condition was caused by an ongoing effect and you donâ€™t remove that effect, the condition returns at the end of your next turn.
