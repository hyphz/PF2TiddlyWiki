Your mind becomes clear and cognition flows freely, but physical matters seem ephemeral.

''Benefit'' You gain an item bonus to [[Arcana]], [[Crafting]], [[Lore]], [[Occultism]], and [[Society]] checks and all checks to [[Recall Knowledge]]. Your critical failures on Recall Knowledge checks become failures instead.

//Greater and Major Cognitive Mutagen also cause you to become trained in a skill for the duration, chosen when the mutagen is created.//

''Drawback'' You take a â€“2 penalty to weapon and unarmed attack rolls, [[Athletics]] checks, and [[Acrobatics]] checks. You can carry 2 less Bulk than normal before becoming encumbered, and the maximum Bulk you can carry is reduced by 4.

| Greater | 11 | 3000 | +3 | 1 hour | Any [[Intelligence]] skill |
