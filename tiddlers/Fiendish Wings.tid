''Frequency'' once per day.

You can strain to call forth bat-like or otherwise fiendish wings from your back, similar in appearance to those of your fiendish ancestors. 

Once manifested, these wings remain for 10 minutes. 

You gain a fly Speed equal to your land Speed while youâ€™ve manifested your wings.
