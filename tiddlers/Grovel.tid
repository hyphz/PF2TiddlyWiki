''Prerequisites'' Trained in [[Deception]].

With obsequious words and begging gestures, you convince your foe youâ€™re less of a threat. 

You attempt to [[Feint]] against a creature. Unlike a normal Feint, the creature can be within 30 feet instead of in your melee reach, and you make your check against its [[Will]] DC instead of its [[Perception]] DC.
