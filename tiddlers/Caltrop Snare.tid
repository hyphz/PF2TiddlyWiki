title: Caltrop Snare
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This snare consists of a hidden canister of [[Caltrops]] attached to a trip wire. When the snare is triggered, it flings the caltrops into either the snareâ€™s square or a square adjacent to the snare. You choose which square when you set up the snare.

If the caltrops scatter into the same square as a creature, that creature must attempt the [[Acrobatics]] check immediately.

''Craft Requirements'' Supply a container of caltrops.
