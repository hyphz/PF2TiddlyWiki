You menace the target, stoking their fears and drawing their attention. 

Attempt an [[Intimidation]] check against the [[Will]] DC of a target within 30 feet. 

If you succeed, for 1 minute, that target gains a +2 status bonus to [[Perception]] checks against you, but they take a â€“2 status penalty to [[Will]] saves against fear effects.
