''Prerequisites'' Trained in [[Diplomacy]].

You are skilled at learning information through conversation.

The [[Gather Information]] exploration activity takes you half as long as normal (typically reducing the time to 1 hour). 

If youâ€™re a master in Diplomacy and you Gather Information at the normal speed, when you attempt to do so and roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead. 

There is still no guarantee that a rumor you learn with Gather Information is accurate.
