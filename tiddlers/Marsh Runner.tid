''Prerequisites'' You have a swim Speed.

You are adept at moving through marshy terrain. 

When you use the [[Step]] action, you can ignore [[Difficult Terrain]] caused by flooding, swamps, or quicksand. 

In addition, when you use the Acrobatics skill to [[Balance]] on narrow surfaces or uneven marshy ground, you arenâ€™t [[Flat-Footed]], and if you roll a success on the Acrobatics check, you get a critical success instead.
