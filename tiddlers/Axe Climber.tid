type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

When you are climbing a wooden surface and have a hatchet or battle axe in each hand, you have a climb Speed equal to half your normal Speed. 

You must still have both legs available to climb and canâ€™t use either of the axes in combat while climbing. 

This feat can also be used to climb a surface of ice if you have a light pick in each hand.
