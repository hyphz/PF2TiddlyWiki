type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Your homunculus familiar has a reservoir for poison, allowing it to apply an injury poison to an adjacent allyâ€™s exposed weapon with a single [[Interact]] action. 

You must supply the poison and instill it into this reservoir using two consecutive [[Interact]] actions. 

You must have a homunculus familiar to select this ability.
