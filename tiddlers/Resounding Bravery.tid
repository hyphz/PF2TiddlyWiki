Even your fears serve as fuel for your fighting spirit. 

When you critically succeed at a [[Will]] save against a foeâ€™s ability, you gain a +1 status bonus to saves and a number of temporary Hit Points equal to half your level for 1 minute. 

These benefits are doubled if you critically succeed against a <<tag Fear>> effect.
