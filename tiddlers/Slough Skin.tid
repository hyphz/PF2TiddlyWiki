{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

You continually and harmlessly slough off the top layer of your skin while new skin regenerates immediately, quickly moving damaging substances away from your body. 

The flat check to remove [[Persistent Damage]] from effects that coat your skin (such as most persistent <<tag Acid>> damage) is reduced to 5, and you gain a +2 status bonus to your initial save against contact poison (but not to further saves, since by that point, the toxin has already entered your system).

If youâ€™re suffering from an effect other than persistent damage that depends on continuous contact with your skin, if that effect allows a saving throw, you receive a new saving throw against that effect at the end of each turn when you attempt your flat checks against persistent
damage, and you also receive a +2 status bonus to those saving throws.

While affected by this spell, your continually shedding skin makes you much easier to [[Track]]. Anyone Tracking you gains a +2 circumstance bonus to do so, and you cannot Hide Your Tracks.
