''Frequency'' once per day.

''Trigger'' You would be reduced to 0 Hit Points but not immediately killed.

Fierceness in battle runs through your blood, and you refuse to fall from your injuries. 

You avoid being knocked out and remain at 1 Hit Point, and your [[Wounded]] condition increases by 1.
