Choose a class other than your own. You gain the multiclass dedication feat for that class, even though you donâ€™t meet its level prerequisite. You must still meet its other prerequisites to gain the feat. __A typical ancient elf is at leats 100 years old, though you might be younger at the GM's discretion.__ //Half-Elves can't take Ancient Elf.//
