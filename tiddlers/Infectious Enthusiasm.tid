With enchanted gusto, you encourage yourself to get things done and share your motivation with your allies.

You gain a +1 status bonus to your choice of attack rolls, [[Will]] saves, or [[Charisma]]-based skill checks. 

During the spellâ€™s duration, an ally who observed you Casting this Spell and was within 30 feet when you did so can take a single action, which has the <<tag Concentrate>> trait, to gain the same bonus you chose until the start of its next turn.

Using this spell to influence someone in a social situation is typically considered a faux pas, negating the benefit on [[Charisma]]-based skills if the subject of the check observed you casting the spell.
