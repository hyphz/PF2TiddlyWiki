''Trigger'' A creature within your reach uses a <<tag Move>> action or leaves a square during a move action itâ€™s using.

You strike out when your foe tries to flee. 

Make a melee [[Strike]] against the triggering creature. 

If the attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a move action, you disrupt that action.
