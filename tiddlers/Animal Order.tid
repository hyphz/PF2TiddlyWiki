You have a strong connection to beasts, and you are allied with a beast companion. 

You are trained in [[Athletics]].

You also gain the [[Animal Companion]] druid feat. 

You gain the [[Heal Animal]] order spell. 

Committing wanton cruelty to animals or killing animals unnecessarily is anathema to your order. (This doesnâ€™t prevent you from defending yourself against animals or killing them cleanly for food.)
