{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

Water blasts upward, coming out of the ground, rising from a pool, or even manifesting from thin air. 

Any creatures in the area take bludgeoning damage equal to 1d4 plus your spellcasting ability modifier, with a basic [[Reflex]] saving throw.

You can change this spellâ€™s area to a 5-foot [[Burst]], provided you center the burst in a body of water. This body of water can be as small as a pond or creek, but not as small as a puddle or bathtub.

''Heightened (+1)'' The damage increases by 1d4.
