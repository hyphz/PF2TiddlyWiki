title: Oil of Unlife
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This thin, black liquid imparts a bone-deep chill while rapidly repairing an undead creatureâ€™s physical or spiritual form. 

When you dash oil of unlife onto an undead creature ({{OneAction}} [[Interact]]), or a living creature with [[Negative Healing]], the oil absorbs quickly into its body, and the creature regains the listed number of Hit Points.

You can pour oil of unlife on an incorporeal undead; in this case, the creature absorbs the oil into itself.
