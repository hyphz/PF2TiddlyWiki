''Requirements'' You are wielding two melee weapons, each in a different hand.

You read your preyâ€™s movements and transform them into openings, so failures with one weapon set up glancing blows with the other. 

Make a melee [[Strike]] with one of the required weapons against your hunted prey. 

The Strike gains the following failure effect: You deal the damage the other required weapon would have dealt on a hit, excluding all damage dice. (This removes dice from weapon runes, spells, and special abilities, not just weapon damage dice.)
