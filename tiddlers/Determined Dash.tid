Nothing can keep you from your enemy. 

[[Stride]] twice. 

During this movement you ignore [[Difficult Terrain]], greater difficult terrain, and any effects that would impose a penalty to Speed. 

You can attempt an [[Athletics]] check instead of an [[Acrobatics]] check to [[Balance]] when moving across narrow surfaces or uneven ground, using the same DC. 

This doesnâ€™t prevent you from being harmed by hazardous terrain. 

You can increase the number of actions this activity takes to 3 to [[Stride]] three times instead.
