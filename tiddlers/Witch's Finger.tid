title: Witch's Finger
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Shaped like a pointed, gnarled finger on a stick, witchâ€™s finger is a frozen treat imbued with berries that lend it a blood-red hue. A popular tale claims witches created this dessert, but the story is apocryphal; an enterprising ice cream shop owner invented the treat and, as a marketing ploy, the myth surrounding it. 

Taking a bite makes you feel warm. For 1 hour, you have <<tag Cold>> resistance 3, and for 8 hours, the treat negates the damage you would take from severe environmental cold and reduces the damage you take from extreme cold to that of severe cold. //(See [[Temperature Effects]]).//
