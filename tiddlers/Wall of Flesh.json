The wall is 3 feet thick, and each 5-foot-long section has AC 10 and 75 HP. If you wish, the wall can be of a smaller length or height. \n\nYou must create the wall in an unbroken open space so its edges don’t pass through any creatures or objects, or the spell is lost. \n\nThe wall can’t be Repaired but can be healed by <<tag Positive>> energy and <<tag Healing>> spells and abilities.\n\nWhen you Cast the Spell, choose one of the following features for your wall.\n\n* ''Mouths'' The wall has countless toothy mouths along its surface. The mouths [[Strike]] any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the wall, using your spell attack roll for these [[Strike]]s and dealing piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier. The mouths are capable of consuming potions; since the wall is alive, it can recover Hit Points from a potion of healing, but it can’t benefit from any effect that would give it the ability to move. Otherwise, the GM determines which potions can affect the wall.\n* ''Eyes'' The wall sprouts hundreds of unblinking eyes. You can see through these eyes, gaining a +2 circumstance bonus to visual [[Perception]] checks within the wall’s line of sight. You can also use the eyes for determining line of sight for ranged attacks and spells, but you don’t have line of effect through the wall.\n* ''Arms'' The wall is a mass of grasping arms. Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the wall must attempt a [[Reflex]] save.\n\n{{||SaveSuccessTable}}\n\n",
