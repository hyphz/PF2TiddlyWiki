//This feat has specific plot and background requirements described in Lost Omens: Legends. In particular, it relates to people living in a city ruled by a god-king who are rebelling against that god-king.//

You become trained in your choice of [[Deception]] or [[Diplomacy]] and in Mzali [[Lore]]; if you were already trained, you become an expert instead. 

You incorporate enough worship of //the god-king// in your daily life to avoid suspicion. You typically donâ€™t need to [[Lie]] or [[Impersonate]] to pass yourself off as a worshipper of //the god-king//. Against careful inspection, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to [[Deception]] checks specifically to pass yourself off as a version of yourself faithful to //the god-king//.
