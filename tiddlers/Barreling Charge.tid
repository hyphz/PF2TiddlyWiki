title: Barreling Charge
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

You rush forward, moving enemies aside to reach your foe.

You [[Stride]], attempting to move through your enemiesâ€™ spaces and make a melee [[Strike]]. 

Roll an [[Athletics]] check and compare the result to the [[Fortitude]] DC of each creature whose space you attempt to move through during your [[Stride]], moving through its space on a success but ending your movement before entering its space on a failure. 

You can use Barreling Charge to Burrow, Climb, Fly, or Swim instead of Stride, as long as you have the corresponding movement type.
