{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

You create a single magical hand, either invisible or ghostlike, that grasps the target object and moves it slowly up to 20 feet. 

Because youâ€™re levitating the object, you can move it in any direction. 

When you [[Sustain the Spell|Sustain a Spell]], you can move the object an additional 20 feet. If the object is in the air when the spell ends, the object falls.

''Heightened (3rd)'' You can target an unattended object with a [[Bulk]] of 1 or less.

''Heightened (5th)'' The range increases to 60 feet, and you can target an unattended object with a Bulk of 1 or less.

''Heightened (7th)'' The range increases to 60 feet, and you can target an unattended object with a Bulk of 2 or less.
