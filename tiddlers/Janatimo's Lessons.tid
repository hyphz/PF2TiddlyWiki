When you use [[Uzunjati Recollection]] to tell a story and [[Recall Knowledge]] about a creature during a combat encounter, if you succeed at both checks, your story carries deeper meaning.

This grants your allies a +1 circumstance bonus to their next attack roll and saving throw against the creature during that encounter, as well as to their AC against that creatureâ€™s next attack roll during that encounter. 

If you critically succeed at both checks, the bonuses also apply to all attack rolls, saves, and AC against that creature for 2 rounds.
