title: Magus's Analysis
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

You make an assessment informed by your knowledge of how a creature fights. 

Attempt a check to [[Recall Knowledge]] about a creature. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your check if you previously hit the creature with a [[Strike]] this turn. 

If your check is successful, recharge your [[Spellstrike]]. 

The subject of your check is temporarily immune to Magusâ€™s Analysis for 1 day.

//You presumably also gain some information about the creature; otherwise, this is just worse than [[Recharge Spellstrike]].//
