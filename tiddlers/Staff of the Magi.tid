title: Staff of the Magi
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki
virtual-tags: Death

Sigils and runes of ancient and powerful magic cover the iron cladding on this long wooden staff. 

A staff of the magi is a [[+3|Weapon Potency]] major [[Striking]] staff, and when wielding it you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against spells.

Voluntarily destroying a staff of the magi unleashes a truly devastating wave of arcane energy that surges out, dissipating with distance. When wielding the staff, you can break it using an [[Interact]] action. This releases a 30-footâ€‘burst magical explosion centered on the staff. This deals 2d10 force damage per charge remaining in the staff (DC 40 basic [[Reflex]] save), You automatically critically fail your save. 

The explosion continues to echo beyond the initial blast zone, dealing half as much damage to creatures beyond 30 feet but within a 60-foot burst. A creature reduced to 0 Hit Points by this damage dies instantly; this is a <<tag Death>> effect.
