title: Disintegration Bolt
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

''Craft Requirements'' Supply one casting of [[Disintegrate]].

Bolt.

The shaft of this bolt is scorched and blackened, and handling it coats your fingers with a fine black powder. 

When an activated ({{OneAction}} <<tag Interact>>) disintegration bolt hits a target, it is subject to a [[Disintegrate]] spell requiring a DC 34 Fortitude save. As with the spell, a critical hit on the attack roll causes the targetâ€™s saving throw outcome to be one degree worse.
