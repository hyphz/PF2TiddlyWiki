title: Deity's Protection
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

When you call upon your deityâ€™s power to fulfill the promise of their domain, you gain divine protection. 

After you cast a domain spell, you gain resistance to all damage until the start of your next turn. The amount of resistance is equal to the level of the domain spell you cast.
