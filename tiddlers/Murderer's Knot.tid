Affix to a weapon.

''Requirements'' You are an expert with the affixed weapon.

''Trigger'' You damage a [[Flat-Footed]] creature with a [[Strike]] using the affixed weapon.

This black strand of leather is tied to look like a peace knot when the weapon is worn, but it doesnâ€™t hamper drawing the weapon. 

When you activate the knot, the creature you damaged takes 1d6 persistent bleed damage.

If you have the [[Twist the Knife]] feat, the talisman instead deals persistent bleed damage equal to your sneak attack damage.
