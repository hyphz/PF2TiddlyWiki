You are so skilled at navigating the wild, your movement is completely unaffected by terrain. 

You ignore the effects of all [[Difficult Terrain]], greater difficult terrain, and hazardous terrain, and you donâ€™t trigger traps and hazards that are triggered by moving into an area (such as trip wires and pressure plates), unless you want to.
