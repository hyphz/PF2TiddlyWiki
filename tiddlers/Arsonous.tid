title: Arsonous

''Usage'' curses a ring, staff, or wand

An arsonous curse creates flaws in the mystic pathways that channel magic through an item, allowing excess power to escape as sparks. 

Whenever you activate the magic item, a random ally within 30 feet takes 1d10 persistent fire damage. If no ally is in range, you take the damage instead. 

At the GMâ€™s discretion, this curse might ignite an unattended object or the surrounding environment instead.
