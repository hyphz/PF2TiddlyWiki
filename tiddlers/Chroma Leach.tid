s-crit: The target is unaffected.
s-fail: The target is [[Enfeebled]] 2 for 1 minute and [[Drained]] 1. The target is also filled with listlessness and ennui. For 1 round, if the target tries to use a <<tag Move>>action, it must succeed at a [[Will]] save against your spell DC or the action is lost; this effect has the <<tag Mental>>and <<tag Emotion>>traits.
s-fumble: As failure, but the creature is permanently [[Enfeebled]] 2 and [[Drained]] 2 (although magic such as [[Restoration]] can reduce or remove these conditions).
s-hit: The target is [[Enfeebled]] 2 for 1 round.

{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

Your hand glows with impossible colors from beyond the stars, and your touch saps both color and vitality from the living.

The target must attempt a [[Fortitude]] save; creatures with the <<tag Gnome>> trait take a â€“2 circumstance penalty to this save.
