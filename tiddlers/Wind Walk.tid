{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

When you cast this spell, each target transforms into a vaguely cloud-like form and is picked up by a wind moving in the direction of your choice. 

You can change the windâ€™s direction by using a single action, which has the <<tag Concentrate>> trait. 

The wind carries the targets at a Speed of 20 miles per hour, but if any of the targets make an attack, Cast a Spell, come under attack, or otherwise enter encounter mode, the spell ends for all targets just after they roll [[Initiative]], and they drift gently to the ground.
