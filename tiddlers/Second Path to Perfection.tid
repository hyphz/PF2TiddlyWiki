type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Youâ€™ve learned to find perfection in every success. 

Choose a different saving throw than the one you chose for your [[Path to Perfection]]. 

Your proficiency rank for the chosen saving throw increases to master. 

If you roll a success with the chosen saving throw, you instead critically succeed.
