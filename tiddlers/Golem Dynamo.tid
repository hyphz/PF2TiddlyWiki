''Access'' You are an [[Automaton]] or are otherwise from the ancient Jistka Imperium.

Youâ€™ve learned the secrets of Jistkan golem prostheses, allowing you to incorporate golem components into your dynamo and gain a portion of their magic. 

You gain a +1 status bonus to saving throws against magic, and your dynamo Strikes become magical.
