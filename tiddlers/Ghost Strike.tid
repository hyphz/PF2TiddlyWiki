type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Once per day, you can infuse a weapon you are carrying with magical energies that allow it to strike true against incorporeal undead. 

The weapon gains the effects of the [[Ghost Touch]] property rune for 10 minutes.

At 10th level, you can apply this effect to two weapons instead of one.
