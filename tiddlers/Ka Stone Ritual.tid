{{LOWGFeat}}

You inscribe your true name on your ka stone, as well as oaths to gods and pharaohs, and embed it in your forehead in a special ritual with a sphinx or with a living monolith who already has this feat. 

The ka stone is an invested magic item that you automatically invest each day. It canâ€™t be removed without your permission, nor can it be dispelled, and you can never lose investiture in the ka stone. 

Its Bulk is negligible.

The ka stone grants you a +1 item bonus to saves against death effects and negative effects, which increases to +2 at 8th level, +3 at 14th level, and +4 at 20th level.

''Activate'' {{TwoAction}} (envision), or a different activation if otherwise specified; ''Frequency'' a number of times each day equal to the number of class feats you have from the Living Monolith archetype; ''Effect'' You cast [[Enlarge]] on yourself or use one of the other activated abilities granted by a later Living Monolith feat.
