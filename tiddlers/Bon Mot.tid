a-actions: 1
a-crit: The target is distracted and takes a -3 status penalty to [[Perception]] and [[Will]] saves for 1 minute. The target can end the effect early with a retort to your Bon Mot. This can either be a single action that has the <<tag Concentrate>> trait or an appropriate skill action to frame their retort. The GM determines which skill actions qualify, though they must take at least 1 action. Typically, the retort needs to use a <<tag Linguistic>> Charisma-based skill action.
a-defense: Will
a-fumble: Your quip is atrocious. You take the same penalty an enemy would take had you succeeded. This ends after 1 minute or if you issue another Bon Mot and succeed.
a-hit: As critical success, but the penalty is -2.
