{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

You bring forth a cloud of razor-sharp flower petals that thrash violently in the wind. 

A creature that enters the storm or starts its turn in the storm is sliced by the razorâ€‘sharp edges of the petals. It takes 2d10 slashing damage with a basic [[Reflex]] save. 

A creature can take damage from the petals only once per round. 

At the end of the duration, the storm calms and the petals fall harmlessly to the ground.

''Heightened (+2)'' The damage increases by 1d10.
