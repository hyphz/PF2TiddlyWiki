title: Skunk Bomb
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Skunk bombs are made from the concentrated odors of creatures with natural or supernatural stench. 

The bomb grants an item bonus to attack rolls and deals poison damage and poison splash damage. 

Any creature hit by the bomb or in its splash area must attempt a [[Fortitude]] saving throw with a DC based on the bombâ€™s type. ''Creatures in the splash area treat the results of their saving
throw as one step better.''

{{||SaveSuccessTable}}

Creatures sickened by the bomb emit an odor that lasts 10 minutes after the sickened condition ends (or 1 hour if they were also blinded). 

The odor can be removed or neutralized by using [[Prestidigitation]] or similar magic or by spending 10 minutes scrubbing with ample soap and water. 

While the odor lasts, creatures within 30 feet can smell the target, enabling even those with a weak sense of smell to detect its presence, and all creatures gain a +1 item bonus to [[Track]] the affected creature for as long as it has the odor. 

A creature that has [[Imprecise]] or [[Precise]] [[Scent]] doubles the range at which it can detect the target using this scent. //(Most player races have [[Vague]] scent.)//
