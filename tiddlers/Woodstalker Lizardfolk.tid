You can always use the [[Take Cover]] action when in forest or jungle terrain to gain cover, even if you’re not next to an obstacle you would normally be able to Take Cover behind. You gain the [[Terrain Stalker]] feat, even if you’re not trained in [[Stealth]], and you must choose underbrush as your chosen terrain.
