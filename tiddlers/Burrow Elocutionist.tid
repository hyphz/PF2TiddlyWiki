You recognize the chittering of ground creatures as its own peculiar language. 

You can ask questions of, receive answers from, and use the [[Diplomacy]] skill with animals that have a burrow Speed, such as badgers, ground squirrels, moles, and prairie dogs. 

The GM determines which animals count for this ability.
