Your dedication to the Godclaw borders on a cleric’s. 

You gain the cleric’s [[Domain Initiate]] feat but must select [[Perfection]], [[Protection]], [[Tyranny]], or [[Zeal]] as your domain. 

In addition, you can use any religious symbol of Abadar, Asmodeus, Iomedae, Irori, or Torag as your divine focus.
