type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

''Prerequisite'' You must be an expert in a melee weapon.

Select a magical effect that has made an adjacent member of your crop [[Clumsy]], [[Grabbed]], [[Paralyzed]], [[Restrained]], or [[Slowed]]. 

Attempt a [[Counteract]] check using your attack modifier (including your [[Multiple Attack Penalty]]) with a melee weapon with which you have expert proficiency. Your counteract level is half your level rounded up. 

On a success, you free that member from the effect; on a failure, you canâ€™t attempt to use Cut the Bonds on that effect on that crop member until 24 hours have passed.
