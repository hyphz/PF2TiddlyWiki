Your plans account for your foesâ€™ resistances, enabling you to strike a telling blow. 

When you hit with a Strike on which you substituted your attack roll due to [[Devising a Stratagem|Devise a Strategem]], you ignore an amount of resistance equal to your Intelligence modifier for each resistance that applies against your attack.
