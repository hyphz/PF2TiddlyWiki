You are an expert in spell attack rolls and DCs of the appropriate magical tradition and you gain a 4th-level spell slot. 

At 14th level, they grant you a 5th-level spell slot, and at 16th level, they grant you a 6th-level spell slot. 

__If you have a spell repertoire, you can select a second spell from your repertoire as a signature spell.__
