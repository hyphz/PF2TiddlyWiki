''Trigger'' You roll [[Initiative]] and can see a creature, you succeed at an [[Attack Roll]] against a creature, or a creature fails a saving throw against one of your spells.

Use a [[Recall Knowledge]] action, rolling the appropriate skill check to identify the triggering creatureâ€™s abilities. You can roll your check twice and use the better result.
