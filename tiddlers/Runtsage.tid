Unlike most of your kind, who dismiss goblins as embarrassments or expendable annoyances, you have studied the methodology behind their irresponsible and incomprehensible actions. 

You gain the [[Adopted Ancestry]] general feat and must select [[Goblin]] as the featâ€™s chosen ancestry. You also gain one 1st-level goblin ancestry feat.
