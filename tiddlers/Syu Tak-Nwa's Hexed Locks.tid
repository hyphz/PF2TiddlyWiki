Your hair unarmed attack gains the reach trait. 

You can deliver hexes through your hair. When you successfully cast a hex focus spell that requires 2 or more actions to cast and that doesnâ€™t require a spell attack roll, if your target is within your reach, as part of the spellcasting activity you can make a hair Strike against the foe before applying any effects of the hex. If this Strike misses, the hex has no effect.
