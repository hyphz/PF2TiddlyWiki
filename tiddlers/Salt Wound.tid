''Frequency'' once per day; 

''Trigger'' A creature that has blood and is not at its maximum Hit Points hits you with a melee [[Strike]]; 

You channel salt and brine from your blood into the creatureâ€™s wounds. 

The creature must attempt a [[Fortitude]] save using your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. 

On a failure, the creature takes 1d6 persistent acid damage and is [[Sickened]] 1 by the pain. On a critical failure, it instead takes 2d6 persistent acid damage and is [[Sickened]] 2.
