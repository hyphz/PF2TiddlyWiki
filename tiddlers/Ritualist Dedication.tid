You have begun to master the difficult art of casting rituals.

You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to all primary checks to perform a ritual. 

You learn two uncommon rituals with a level no higher than half your level; you must meet all prerequisites for casting the ritual to choose it. 

At 8th level and every 4 levels thereafter, you learn another uncommon ritual with a level no higher than half your level and for which you meet the prerequisites. 

You can cast these as the primary caster, but you canâ€™t teach them to anyone else or allow someone else to serve as primary caster unless they know the ritual as well.
