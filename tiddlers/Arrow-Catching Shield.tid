This remarkable wooden shield (Hardness 10, HP 60, BT 30) is carved with images of overlapping fletched arrows.

''Activate'' {{ReactionIcon}} Interact; ''Frequency'' once per minute; ''Trigger'' A ranged weapon [[Strike]] targets a creature within 15 feet of you when you have this shield raised, and the attacker has not yet rolled their attack; ''Effect'' The triggering Strike tragets you instead of its normal target. If it hits, you gain the effects of the [[Shield Block]] reaction.
