type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Orichalcum weapons can have four magic property runes instead of three.

Due to orichalcumâ€™s temporal properties, etching the [[Speed|Speed (Rune)]] weapon property rune onto an orichalcum weapon costs half the normal Price (though transferring the rune to a weapon made of another material requires you to first pay the remaining Price and then pay the cost to transfer).

| !Type | !Level | !Price | !Value of Orichalcum needed |
| High-Grade | 18 | 225000 + 22500/Bulk | 112500 + 11250/Bulk |
