Arcane spellcasters use logic and rationality to categorize the magic inherent in the world around them. 

Because of its far-reaching approach, the arcane tradition has the broadest spell list, though itâ€™s generally poor at affecting the spirit or the soul. 

[[Wizard]]s are the most iconic arcane spellcasters, poring over tomes and grimoires, though arcane [[Sorcerer]]s study the secrets of their blood to unlock the power within themselves.
