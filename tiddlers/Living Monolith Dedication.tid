{{LOWGFeat}}

Youâ€™ve begun to inscribe a magical stone called a ka stone that you will some day tie to your soul. You gain knowledge of Ancient Osirion and a connection to your nascent ka stone. 

If you fail a recovery check while [[Dying]], your dying condition does not increase; if you critically fail, your dying condition increases by only 1. 

You become trained in Ancient Osirion [[Lore]], or expert if you were already trained.
