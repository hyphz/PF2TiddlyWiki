You can throw this weapon as a ranged attack. 

A thrown weapon adds your [[Strength]] modifier to damage just like a melee weapon does. 

When this trait appears on a melee weapon, it also includes the range increment. 

Ranged weapons with this trait use the range increment specified in the weaponâ€™s Range entry.
