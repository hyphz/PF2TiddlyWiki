Your dual human and orc nature has given you a unique perspective, allowing you to bridge the gap between humans and the many intelligent creatures in the world that humans consider monsters. 

You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [[Diplomacy]] checks against non-humanoid intelligent creatures and against humanoids that are marginalized in human society (at the GMâ€™s discretion, but typically at least including giants, goblins, kobolds, and orcs). 

You also gain this bonus on [[Perception]] checks to [[Sense the Motives|Sense Motive]] of such creatures.
