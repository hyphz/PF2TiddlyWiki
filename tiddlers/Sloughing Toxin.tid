title: Sloughing Toxin
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This complex toxin makes the muscles beneath a creatureâ€™s skin loose and malleable, which fleshwarpers find useful in their work. Rough or jerky movements the victim performs concentrate the toxin in subdermal muscles and eventually cause skin and muscle to slough away.
