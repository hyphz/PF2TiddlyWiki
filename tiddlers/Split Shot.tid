title: Split Shot
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

You fragment a ranged spell into a pair of smaller shots. 

If your next action is to [[Cast a Spell]] without a duration that requires an attack roll against a single target and has no effect beyond dealing damage, you roll a single attack roll and compare the result to the AC of two targets within the spellâ€™s range. 

The spell deals only half its usual damage to each target. 

This counts as one attack for your multiple attack penalty.
