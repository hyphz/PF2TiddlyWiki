{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

You grant an ally a token of favor. 

You create a token, such as a lock of your hair or a flower, that persists for the spellâ€™s duration; as part of Casting the Spell, you can [[Interact]] to pass the token to an ally within your reach. 

As long as the ally has the token on their person, they gain a +1 status bonus to [[Performance]] checks and [[Will]] saves. 

You can [[Dismiss]] the spell as a free action.

''Heightened (4th)'' As long as the ally has the token on their person, you can cast spells that have a range of [[Touch]] on them at a range of 30 feet.
