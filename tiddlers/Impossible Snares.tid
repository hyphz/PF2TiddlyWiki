You can create endless shorter-lived snares, protecting your lair or using them against foes. 

Once per minute, you can [[Craft]] one of the snares youâ€™ve prepared for quick deployment without expending the prepared snare. 

Once deployed, such a snare lasts for 10 minutes before losing its effectiveness.
