{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

__Plants and fungi burst out or quickly grow__, entangle creatures. 

__All surfaces in the area__ are [[Difficult Terrain]]. 

Each round that a creature starts its turn in the area, it must attempt a [[Reflex]] save. 

On a failure, it takes a â€“10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds until it leaves the area, and
on a critical failure, it is also [[Immobilized]] for 1 round. 

Creatures can attempt to [[Escape]] to remove these effects.
