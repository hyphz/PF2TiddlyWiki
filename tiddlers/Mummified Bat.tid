Affix to a weapon.

''Requirements'' You are a master in [[Perception]].

This talisman is the magically treated corpse of a tiny bat bound in papyrus. 

When you activate {{OneAction}} the bat, the affixed weapon detects vibrations around you and guides your perception. You gain the benefits of the fighter [[Blind-Fight]] class feat for 1 minute.

If you have the Blind-Fight feat, you gain [[Imprecise]] echolocation with a range of 30 feet for 1 minute. This makes creatures that would be [[Undetected]] by you because you canâ€™t see them [[Hidden]] instead.
