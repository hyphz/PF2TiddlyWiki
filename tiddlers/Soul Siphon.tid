{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

You siphon off a portion of the targetâ€™s soul to bolster your own vitality. 

The target //takes 1d4// <<tag Negative>> damage //with a basic [[Fortitude]] save//.

//In addition, if the target fails the save they become [[Drained]] 1. If they critically fail, they become [[Drained]] 2.// 

You gain temporary Hit Points equal to the total amount of HP the target loses, including the HP lost from becoming drained.

''Heightened (+1)'' Increase the damage by 1d4.
