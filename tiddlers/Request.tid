title: Request
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

You can make a request of a creature thatâ€™s [[Friendly]] or [[Helpful]] to you. 

You must couch the request in terms that the target would accept given their current attitude toward you. 

The GM sets the [[Diplomacy]] DC based on the difficulty of the request. Some requests are unsavory or impossible, and even a helpful NPC would never agree to them.
