type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

You can perform simple [[Interact]] actions with your tail, such as opening an unlocked door. 

Your tail can’t perform actions that require fingers or significant manual dexterity, including any action that would require a check to accomplish, and you can’t use it to hold items.
