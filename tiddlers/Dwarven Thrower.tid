This [[+2|Weapon Potency]] [[Striking]] warhammer is inlaid with precious metals and decorated with geometric patterns in a dwarven style. 

If youâ€™re a dwarf, a dwarven thrower functions for you as a +2 greater striking [[Returning]] warhammer with the thrown 30 feet trait, and your attacks with the hammer deal 1d8 additional damage against giants.
