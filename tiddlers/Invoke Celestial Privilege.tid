''Trigger'' You attempt a saving throw against a <<tag Divine>> effect, but you havenâ€™t rolled yet.

You rise above the triggering effect, refusing to be harmed by it. 

You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the triggering saving throw and to any other saving throws you attempt against divine effects until the start of your next turn.
