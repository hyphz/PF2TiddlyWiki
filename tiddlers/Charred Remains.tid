''Frequency'' once per day

Your next fire spell leaves embers in its wake. 

If your next action is to [[Cast a Spell]] with an area and the <<tag Fire>> trait, for 1 minute, your spellâ€™s area becomes [[Difficult Terrain]] as well as Hazardous Terrain, dealing 1 fire damage for each square a creature moves through.
