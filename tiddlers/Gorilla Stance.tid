title: Gorilla Stance
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

You lower yourself to the ground and take an imposing, knuckleâ€‘walking stance. 

While in this stance, the only Strikes you can make are gorilla slam unarmed attacks. These deal 1d8 bludgeoning damage; are in the brawling group; and have the [[Backswing]], [[Forceful]], [[Grapple]], [[Nonlethal]], and [[Unarmed]] traits. 

While you are in Gorilla Stance, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Athletics checks to Climb, and if you roll a success on an Athletics check to Climb, you get a critical success instead.
