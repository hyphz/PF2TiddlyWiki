type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Years of experience among ratfolk communities have made you nimble, and youâ€™ve learned to run and hide when enemies threaten. 

You gain the trained proficiency rank in [[Acrobatics]] and [[Stealth]]. If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. 

You also become trained in Ratfolk [[Lore]].
