''Frequency'' once per day

''Trigger'' You would take bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage.

Your body anticipates the blow. The impact area briefly reorganizes into a strengthened tissue lattice that blunts the attack. 

You gain resistance equal to your level to the triggering damage type, which applies against the triggering damage.

If you have the [[Crystalline Dust]] feat, you can use Preemptive Reconfiguration without expending a usage of the reaction for the purpose of the featâ€™s Frequency limit. Instead, the usage counts toward your number of Crystalline Dust uses per day, as if you had used that feat instead.
