You are practiced at working in vast garages of vehicles and can work on many machines at a time. 

When [[Repair]]ing and spending the full 10 minutes, you can fix up to two objects. If you are a master in Crafting, you can fix up to four targets. If youâ€™re legendary in Crafting, you can fix up to eight targets.

This feat has no effect when using [[Quick Repair]] or another ability to reduce the time spent Repairing.
