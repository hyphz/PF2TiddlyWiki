type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Your tongue darts out faster than the eye can see to retrieve loose objects. 

You [[Interact]] to pick up a single unattended object of light Bulk or less within 10 feet of you. If you donâ€™t have enough hands free to hold the object, it falls to the ground in your space.
