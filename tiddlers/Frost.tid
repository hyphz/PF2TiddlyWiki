''Usage'' etched onto a weapon.

This weapon is empowered with freezing ice. 

It deals an additional 1d6 <<tag Cold>> damage on a successful [[Strike]]. 

On a critical hit, the target is also [[Slowed]] 1 until the end of your next turn unless it succeeds at a DC 24 [[Fortitude]] save.

''Greater Frost'': The save DC is 34. Cold damage dealt by this weapon ignores the targetâ€™s cold resistance.
