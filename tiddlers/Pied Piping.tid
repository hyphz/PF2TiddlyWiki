{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

Your performance enraptures those who hear it, compelling them to follow you about in admiration. 

Each creature within the emanation must attempt a Will save when you Cast the Spell or the first time they enter the area, after which they become temporarily immune for 1 day. 

Once per turn, you can spend a single action, which has the <<tag Concentrate>> trait, to increase the emanationâ€™s radius by 5 feet. 

You can [[Dismiss]] the spell.
