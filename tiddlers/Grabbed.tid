title: Grabbed
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Youâ€™re held in place by another creature, giving you the [[Flat-Footed]] and [[Immobilized]] conditions. 

If you attempt a [[Manipulate]] action while grabbed, you must succeed at a DC 5 flat check or it is lost; roll the check after spending the action, but before any effects are applied.
