This shimmering paste has many properties of a shield spell.

When you slather it onto a creature or object ({{OneAction}} [[Interact]]), the target gains a +1 circumstance bonus to AC for 1 round. 

The first time a physical attack or a magic missile hits the target during that round, the oil prevents 5 damage from that attack or spell, and then the oilâ€™s effect ends.
