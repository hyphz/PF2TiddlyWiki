{{LOCGFeat}}

''Prerequisites'' Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution 14.

Your Swords training taught you to never lose hold of your weapon. 

You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your [[Reflex]] DC when foes attempt to [[Disarm]] you. 

If you have the [[Deft Cooperation]] feat and critically succeed on a check to [[Aid]] an allyâ€™s attack roll or skill check, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus from Deft Cooperation (instead of a +1 bonus) the first time you attempt an attack roll or attempt a skill check where the bonus would apply.
