title: Bloodletting Fangs
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

You emulate your vampiric parentâ€™s techniques for drawing blood from a victim. 

Your fangs [[Strike]]s deal an additional 1d4 persistent bleed damage on a critical hit.

//This feat doesn't give you fangs if you don't have them. Just being a Dhampir doesn't give you fangs unless you take the [[Fangs {Dhampir)]] feat.//
