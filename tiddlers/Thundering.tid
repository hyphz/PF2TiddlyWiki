''Usage'' etched onto a weapon.

This weapon lets out a peal of thunder when it hits, dealing an extra 1d6 <<tag Sonic>> damage on a successful [[Strike]]. 

On a critical hit, the target has to succeed at a DC 24 [[Fortitude]] save or be deafened for 1 minute (or 1 hour on a critical failure).

''Greater Thundering:'' The save DC is 34, and the deafness is permanent. Sonic damage dealt by this weapon ignores the targetâ€™s sonic resistance.
