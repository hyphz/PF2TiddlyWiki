''Trigger'' You critically succeed at a [[Strike]] or [[Disarm]] with your Aldori dueling sword.

Your incredible skill with your blade unnerves your foes. 

You attempt to [[Demoralize]] the target of your Strike or Disarm. 

This Demoralize attempt does not have the auditory trait, nor do you take a penalty to the check if the target doesnâ€™t understand your language.
