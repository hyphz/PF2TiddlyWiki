type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Make two unarmed [[Strike]]s. 

If both hit the same creature, combine their damage for the purpose of resistances and weaknesses. 

Apply your [[Multiple Attack Penalty]] to the Strikes normally. 

As it has the flourish trait, you can use Flurry of Blows only once per turn.
