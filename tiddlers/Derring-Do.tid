When you compound panache with even more derring-do, it somehow tends to work out. 

When you already have [[Panache]], you can roll twice and use the higher result on checks to which the circumstance bonus for having panache applies ([[Tumble Through]] and any skill actions listed in your swashbucklerâ€™s style).
