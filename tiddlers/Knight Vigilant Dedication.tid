{{LOCGFeat}}

//The book calls this feat just "Knight Vigilant", omitting the word Dedication.//

You are dedicated to the cause of the Shining Sentinels. 

You gain expert proficiency in [[Religion]]. 

When you are between an ally and a foe and would provide lesser cover to your ally against the foeâ€™s attacks, you twist to become even more obtrusive, providing standard cover instead.
