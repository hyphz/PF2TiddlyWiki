{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

You call upon your muse to greatly increase the benefits you provide to your allies with your [[Inspire Courage]], [[Inspire Defense]] //or [[Song of Strength]]// composition. 

If your next action is to cast inspire courage or inspire defense, attempt a [[Performance]] check. The DC is usually a very hard DC of a level equal to that of the highest-level target of your composition, but the GM can assign a different DC based on the circumstances. 

The effect of your inspire courage or inspire defense composition depends on the result of your check.
