This wide leather belt grants you a +1 item bonus to [[Athletics]] checks and increases the amount you can easily carry. 

You can carry Bulk equal to 6 + your [[Strength]] modifier before becoming encumbered, and you can hold and carry a total Bulk up to 11 + your Strength modifier.

''Activate'' {{TwoAction}} Interact; ''Effect'' You lift an object of up to 8 Bulk as though it were weightless. This requires two hands, and if the object is locked or otherwise held in place, you can attempt to [[Force it Open|Force Open]] using [[Athletics]] as part of this activation. The object still has its full weight and Bulk for all other purposesâ€”you just ignore that weight. The effect lasts until the end of your next turn.
