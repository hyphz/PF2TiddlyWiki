title: Halo
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

You are surrounded by a halo of light and goodness at all times. 

Your halo sheds light with the effects of a <<tag Divine>> [[Light]] cantrip. A cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up. 

You can suppress or reestablish the halo with a single action, which has the <<tag Concentrate>> trait.
