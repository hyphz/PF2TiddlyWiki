title: Revealing Mist
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Kept in an airtight spray bottle, revealing mist is an alchemical concoction that creates a sticky and clinging mist of chemicals in a [[Cone]] when sprayed ({{OneAction}} [[Interact]]). 

It doesnâ€™t affect visibility but causes [[Invisible]] creatures in the area to be [[Concealed]] rather than [[Undetected]]. 

Revealing mist is ineffective in water or in areas with other factors affecting the spread of the mist, as determined by the GM. 

It remains in the area for 1 minute or until any significant wind disperses it, whichever comes first.
