You use your occult lore and the power of your mind to manipulate the spiritual multiverse, resulting in any of the following effects:

* Duplicate any occult spell of 9th level or lower.
* Duplicate any non-occult spell of 7th level or lower.
* Produce any effect whose power is equivalent to any occult spell 9th level or lower, or non occult spell 7th level or lower.
* Reverse certain effects that refer to the [[Wish]]. spell

At the GMâ€™s discretion, you can try to produce greater effects, but this is dangerous and the spell may have only a partial effect.
