''Additive 2''.

''Frequency'' once per round.

''Trigger'' You craft an alchemical bomb using [[Quick Alchemy]] thatâ€™s at least 2 levels lower than your advanced alchemy level.

You mix a substance into the bomb to foil resistances. 

The bomb reduces any resistance the enemy has to its damage type by an amount equal to your level, but only for that attack.
