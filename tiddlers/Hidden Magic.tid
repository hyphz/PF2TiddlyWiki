Youâ€™ve learned to hide the magical auras of your gear.

During your daily preparations, you carefully tweak any or all of your magic items to appear non-magical. 

Objects adjusted in this way remain so until your next preparations.

A spellcaster using [[Detect Magic]] or [[Read Aura]] must succeed at a [[Perception]] check against your [[Deception]] DC to see through your obfuscations.
