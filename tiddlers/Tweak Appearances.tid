{{AoA3Feat}}

You spend 1 minute making quick adjustments to someoneâ€™s clothing and appearance, causing their words to carry more weight with an audience of your choice. 

While speaking to that audience, the target gains a +1 item bonus to [[Diplomacy]] and [[Performance]] checks. 

If you have master proficiency in [[Crafting]], the bonus increases to +2; if you have legendary proficiency in Crafting, the bonus increases to +3. 

This bonus lasts until this ability is used on the target again, the situation they were prepared for ends, or they next change their outfit.
