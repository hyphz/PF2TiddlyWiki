''Power Suit'' only.

Your armor supports your muscles with a carefully crafted exoskeleton. When you send your armor into overdrive, the exoskeleton supplements your feats of athletics as well. 

When under the effects of [[Overdrive]], you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Athletics checks; if youâ€™re a master in [[Crafting]], this increases to a +2 circumstance bonus.
