You can focus your superstition to break the magic of an item, in addition to destroying freestanding spells and those active on creatures. 

When you [[Sunder a Spell|Sunder Spell]], you can instead attempt to [[Counteract]] either an unattended magic item or one of your targetâ€™s magic items. 

If your counteract attempt succeeds, the item becomes a mundane item of its type for 10 minutes. 

If you target an artifact, an intelligent item, or a particularly powerful item, your counteract attempt automatically fails.
