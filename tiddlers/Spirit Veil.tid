{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

You draw an occluding veil of spirits around yourself, blocking yourself especially well from undead eyes. 

You become [[Concealed]] to all creatures, and you are hidden from undead creatures regardless of what precise senses they have; this grants the effects of [[invisibility|Invisible]], but against all the undead creatureâ€™s precise senses. 

If you physically interact with an undead creature or use a [[Hostile Action]], the spell ends. 

''Heightened (+1)'' You can target one additional willing creature within 30 feet. The spell ends if any target physically interacts with an undead creature or uses a hostile action.
