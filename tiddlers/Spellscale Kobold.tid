Choose one cantrip from the <<tag Arcane>> spell list. You can Cast this Spell as an arcane innate spell at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up. You gain the trained proficiency rank in arcane spell attack rolls and spell DCs, and your key spellcasting ability is [[Charisma]].
