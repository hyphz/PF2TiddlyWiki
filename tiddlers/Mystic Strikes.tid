Focusing your will into your physical attacks imbues them with mystical energy. 

Your unarmed attacks become <<tag Magical>>, allowing them to get past resistances
to non-magical attacks. 

However, you still need an item such as __[[Handwraps of Mighty Blows]]__ to gain an item bonus to attack rolls or increase your attacksâ€™ weapon damage dice.
