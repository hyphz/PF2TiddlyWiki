You have forgotten more about talismans than lesser warriors have ever known. 

Normally, affixing more than one talisman to an item causes the talismans to be suppressed, but when you [[Affix a Talisman]], you can specially treat one item youâ€™re working on, allowing it to have two active talismans at once.

This special treatment ends if you use Affix a Talisman to treat a new item for this ability.
