You can’t see. 

All normal terrain is [[Difficult Terrain]] to you. 

You can’t detect anything using vision. 

You automatically critically fail [[Perception]] checks that require you to be able to see, and if vision is your only precise sense, you take a –4 status penalty to [[Perception]] checks. 

You are immune to [[Visual]] effects. 

Blinded overrides [[Dazzled]].
