If you choose fire, fire and elemental themed spells below deal fire damage; otherwise they deal bludgeoning damage. //(For example, [[Fireball]] below becomes a ball of water if you chose a water elemental.)// __Replace any existing elemental traits with the trait of the element you chose.__

bl-magic: Elemental energy surrounds you or a target. Either you gain a +1 status bonus to Intimidation checks for 1 round, or a target takes 1 damage per spell level. The damage is bludgeoning or fire, according to your elemental type. If the spell already deals that type of damage, combine it with the spellâ€™s initial damage before determining weaknesses and resistances.
