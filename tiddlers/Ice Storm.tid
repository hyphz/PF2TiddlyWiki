{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

You create a gray storm cloud that pelts creatures with an icy deluge. 

When you Cast the Spell, a burst of magical hail deals 2d8 bludgeoning damage and 2d8 cold damage to each creature in the area below the cloud (basic [[Reflex]] save). 

Snow and sleet continue to rain down in the area for the remainder of the spellâ€™s duration, making the area [[Difficult Terrain]]. 

Any creature that ends its turn in the storm takes __2__ <<tag Cold>> damage. 

If you Cast this Spell outdoors, you can create two non-overlapping clouds instead of one. __As normal, if a big creature is in both clouds, it still only takes the initial damage once and the continued damage once per turn.__

''Heightened (+2)'' The initial bludgeoning damage and cold damage increase by 1d8 each, and the cold damage creatures take at the end of their turns increases by __1__.
