{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

You take on the stance of the flowing winds, sending out waves of energy at a distance. 

You can make "wind crash" unarmed [[Strike]]s as ranged Strikes against targets within 30 feet. These deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage, use the brawling group, and have the [[Agile]], [[Nonlethal]], [[Propulsive]], and [[Unarmed]] traits. Wind crash Strikes ignore concealment and all cover.

While entering the stance is a ki spell, the wind crash Strikes the stance grants are not, so you can use them as often as you like while in the stance.

While in wild winds stance, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to AC against ranged attacks.
