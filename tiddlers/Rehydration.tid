type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

You surround your body with a thin layer of water drawn from the moisture in the air. 

You can spend one hour resting to rehydrate your gills and skin, which counts as [[submerging your body in water|Hydration]]. 

At the GMâ€™s discretion, incredibly dry areas, such as deserts, might not have enough moisture in the air for your Rehydration to work.
