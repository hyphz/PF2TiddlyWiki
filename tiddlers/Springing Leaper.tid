Your powerful legs allow you to make sudden and dramatic leaps. 

You can [[Leap]] as a 2-action activity to double the distance you can Leap vertically, or Leap as a 3-action activity to triple the distance you can Leap vertically. 

You donâ€™t automatically fail [[Long Jump]]s for jumping in a different direction than your Stride.
