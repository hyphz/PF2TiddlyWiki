type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

You canâ€™t recover from being [[Unconscious]] and must attempt a DC 20 [[Fortitude]] save at the end of each of your turns. 

On a failure, you take 1d10 damage, and on a critical failure, you die. 

On each check after the first, the DC increases by 5 and the damage by 1d10; these increases are cumulative. 

Once your access to air is restored, you stop suffocating and are no longer Unconscious (unless you're at 0 Hit Points).
