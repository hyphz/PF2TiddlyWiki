Falsehoods pass your lips as smoothly as silk. 

You gain a +4 status bonus to [[Deception]] checks to [[Lie]] and against Perception checks to discern if you are telling the truth, and you add your level even if youâ€™re untrained. 

If the implausibility of your lies prompts a circumstance penalty or a DC increase, reduce that penalty or increase by half.
