title: Swarm Mind
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This monster doesn’t have a single mind (typically because it’s a swarm of smaller creatures).

It is immune to [[Mental]] effects that target only a specific number of creatures. 

It is still subject to mental effects that affect all creatures in an area.
