You frighten a foe into moving where you want them, traditionally demanding they walk the plank. 

Attempt to [[Demoralize]] an opponent; this check gains the incapacitation trait //(so to succeed against an opponent of higher level you must roll a critical success)//.

On a success, in addition to the normal effects, you can also force the target to [[Stride]] up to its Speed. 

You choose the path the target takes, and it does so as part of your Walk the Plank action. 

You canâ€™t force the target to move into a harmful space (one where it will take damage, fall, provoke reactions, or similar) unless the result of your check to Demoralize was a critical success. //(Which it cannot be if the opponent is of higher level.)//

The target then becomes temporarily immune to Walk the Plank for 24 hours.
