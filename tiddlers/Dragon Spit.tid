{{LOCGFeat}}

You can spit energy, and you might have an especially visible sign of your draconic heritage. 

Choose one of the following cantrips: [[Acid Splash]], [[Electric Arc]], [[Produce Flame]], or [[Ray of Frost]]. You can cast this spell as an innate arcane spell at will, and when you cast it, the spellâ€™s energy emerges from your mouth.
