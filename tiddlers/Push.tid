''Requirements'' The monsterâ€™s last action was a success with a [[Strike]] that lists Push in its damage entry. 

The monster automatically knocks the target away from the monster. 

Unless otherwise noted  in the ability description, the creature is pushed 5 feet. 

If the attack was a critical hit, this distance is doubled.

//This is a monster ability. The equivalent for player characters is [[Shove]].//
