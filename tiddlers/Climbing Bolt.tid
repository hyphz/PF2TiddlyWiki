Bolt.

The shaft of this bolt is wrapped with fine twine. 

When the bolt strikes a solid surface, the twine unwinds and enlarges into a 50-foot-long rope, securely fastened to the surface the bolt struck. 

The rope can be pulled free with an [[Interact]] action and a successful DC 20 [[Athletics]] check.
