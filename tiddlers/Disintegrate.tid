{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

You fire a green ray at your target. 

Make a spell attack. 

__On a hit,__ you deal 12d10 damage, and the target must attempt a basic [[Fortitude]] save. On a critical hit, treat the save result as one degree worse. 

A creature reduced to 0 HP is reduced to fine powder; its gear remains.

An object you hit is destroyed (no save), regardless of Hardness, unless itâ€™s an artifact or similarly hard to destroy.

A single casting can destroy no more than a 10-foot cube of matter. 

This automatically destroys any force construct, such as a [[Wall of Force]].

''Heightened (+1)'' The damage increases by 2d10.
