''Trigger'' You attempt a saving throw against a magical effect but havenâ€™t rolled yet.

Your ancestral resistance to magic protects you. 

You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the triggering saving throw. 

If the triggering effect is <<tag Arcane>>, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus instead.

//The action's name is flavor text. The ancestry of the magic user has no effect.//
