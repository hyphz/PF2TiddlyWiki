{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

You summon a tumultuous cloud of ash and smoke. 

The cloud is [[Difficult Terrain]] for flying creatures, and creatures in the cloud canâ€™t detect anything using their sense of smell. 

Creatures that start their turn within the cloud take 2d4 fire damage as their lungs fill with the hot, acrid smoke, with a Fortitude save.
