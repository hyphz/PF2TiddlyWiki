{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

Cloaked in illusion, the target becomes [[Invisible]]. 

This makes it [[Undetected]] to all creatures //who have vision as their precise sense//, though the creatures can attempt to find the target, making it [[Hidden]] to them instead. 

If the target uses a [[Hostile Action]], the spell ends after that hostile action is completed.

''Heightened (4th)'' The spell lasts 1 minute, but it doesnâ€™t end if the target uses a hostile action.
