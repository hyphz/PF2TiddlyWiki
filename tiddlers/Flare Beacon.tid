title: Flare Beacon
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Flare beacons create an incredibly bright light for a brief period of time. They are often used to signal others to the beaconâ€™s location, to coordinate assaults, to request rescue, or for other similar reasons. Higher-level beacons have a radius so large that they can be seen from miles away at night. 

When you [[Activate]] //(2 [[Interact]] actions)/// a flare beacon, you can either place it on the ground in a space within your reach or toss it up to 60 feet straight up. The beacon then sparks into being, casting bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light in the next 20 feet for 1 minute. 

A flare beacon in the air falls at a rate of 10 feet per round. Creatures adjacent to a flare beacon must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or be dazzled until they are no longer adjacent to it. //(Upgraded beacons have higher dazzling radiuses. These represent both how close a creature must be in order to need to make a save, and the area they must leave in order to no longer be dazzled.)//

//If a beacon is listed as Blinding, creatures who critically fail the Fortitude save against being dazzled are also [[Blinded]] for 1 round.//
