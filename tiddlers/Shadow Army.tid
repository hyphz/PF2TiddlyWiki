{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

You create dozens of semi-real copies of yourself that swarm across the battlefield and fight your enemies. 

You are virtually indistinguishable from your clones, allowing you to [[Hide]] and [[Sneak]] among them. 

An enemy thatâ€™s in the area when the spell is cast or that ends its turn in the area takes 3d10 <<tag Mental>> damage and 3d10 bludgeoning damage, and is possibly inflicted with a condition, depending on the result of its [[Will]] save. 

When you Cast the Spell, you choose a condition your shadows impose on a failed save: [[Clumsy]] 2, [[Enfeebled]] 2, [[Flat-Footed]], or [[Slowed]] 1.
