You launch yourself through the air at a foe. 

Attempt a [[High Jump]] or [[Long Jump]]. 

If you attempt a High Jump, determine the distance you can travel using the scale of a Long Jump. 

At the end of your jump, you can make a melee [[Strike]]. 

After your Strike, you [[fall|Falling]] to the ground if youâ€™re in the air.

If the distance of your fall is no more than the height of your jump, you take no damage and land upright.
