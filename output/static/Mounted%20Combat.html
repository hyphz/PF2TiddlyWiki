<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>You can ride some creatures into combat. </p><p>As noted in the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Mount.html">Mount</a> specialty basic action, your mount needs to be at least one size larger than you and willing. </p><p>Your mount acts on your initiative. </p><p>You must use the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Command%2520an%2520Animal.html">Command an Animal</a> action to get your mount to spend its actions. If you don’t, the animal wastes its actions. For example, if you are mounted on a horse and you make three attacks, your horse would remain stationary since you didn’t command it. If you instead spent your first action to Command an Animal and succeeded, you could get your mount to <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Stride.html">Stride</a>. You could spend your next action to attack or to command the horse to attack, but not both.</p><p>For an intelligent mount (such as a pegasus or unicorn), use the standard rules for mounted combat, but instead of attempting a check to Command an Animal, the rider uses the same number of actions to ask the creature to do what they want. As the GM, you determine whether the creature does as requested and whether <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Diplomacy.html">Diplomacy</a> checks or the like are needed. It’s recommended you disallow humanoid creatures and most other bipeds as mounts, especially if they are PCs. If you choose to allow this anyway, either the rider or mount should use at least one hand to hold onto the other, and both should spend an action on each of their turns to remain mounted.</p><p>If you have the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Ride.html">Ride</a> general feat, you succeed automatically when you Command an Animal that’s your mount. </p><p>When you’re mounted, attackers can target either you or your mount. Anything that affects multiple creatures (such as an area) affects both of you as long as you’re both in the area. </p><p>You are in an attacker’s reach or range if any square of your mount is within reach or range. Because your mount is larger than you and you share its space, you have lesser cover against attacks targeting you when you’re mounted if the mount would be in the way.</p><p>Because you can’t move your body as freely while you’re riding a mount, you take a –2 circumstance penalty to Reflex saves while mounted. Additionally, the only move action you can use is the Mount action to dismount.</p></div>
