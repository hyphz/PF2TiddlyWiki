Your rage comes from a deep and purely personal well within you. 

You use your rage as you choose.

You donâ€™t have an anathema or an instinct ability. Instead, you gain an additional 1st-level barbarian feat. //You only gain this ability automatically if you are a [[Barbarian]], not if you just have [[Barbarian Dedication]].//

''Specialization Ability'': Increase the additional damage from Rage from 2 to 6. If you have [[Greater Weapon Specialization]], instead increase the additional damage from Rage to 12. //You only gain this ability automatically if you are a [[Barbarian]], not if you just have [[Barbarian Dedication]].//

''Raging Resistance'': You resist physical weapon damage, but not physical
damage from other sources (such as unarmed attacks). //You only gain this ability automatically if you are a [[Barbarian]], not if you just have [[Barbarian Dedication]].//
