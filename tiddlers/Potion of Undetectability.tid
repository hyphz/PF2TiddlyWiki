type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Drinking this dull-black liquid makes you undetectable to divinations. 

This grants the same effects as [[Mind Blank]], but without the bonus against <<tag Mental>> effects. 

You also gain the effects of a 4th-level [[Invisibility]] spell, which protects against [[See Invisibility]] spells of 8th level and lower and has a DC of 36 against [[True Seeing]]. 

The potionâ€™s effects last for 10 minutes.
