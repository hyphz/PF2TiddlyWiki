''Usage'' Etched onto a weapon.

This rune prevents enemies from escaping your grasp by fleeing to other planes. 

If you critically hit a target with an anchoring weapon, the weapon casts [[Dimensional Anchor]] on the target (DC 27, counteract modifier +17).

''Greater Anchoring'': When you critically hit a target with a weapon with the //greater// anchoring rune, the weapon casts 8th-level [[Dimensional Anchor]] on the target (DC 38, counteract modifier +28), except that if the target critically succeeds at its Will save, instead of having no effect, the dimensional anchor lasts for 1 round. When you hit a target with the weapon but donâ€™t critically hit, the target is affected by 4th-level [[Dimensional Anchor]] for 1 round without a save (this still uses a counteract modifier of +28).
