You’re trained in an additional skill in which the clockwork entity is well-versed, determined by the GM. 

Any time you attempt a skill check for the entity’s skill, the GM can offer you a +1 circumstance bonus to the check, as though the entity were [[Aid]]ing you. If you accept but fail the check, the entity clenches up and you are [[Stunned]] 1 ([[Stunned]] 2 on a critical failure).
