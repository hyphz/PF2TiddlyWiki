title: Mature Animal Companion (Druid)
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Your animal companion grows up, becoming a mature animal companion, which grants it additional capabilities. 

Your animal companion is better trained than most. During an encounter, even if you donâ€™t
use the [[Command an Animal]] action, your animal companion can still use 1 action on your turn that round to [[Stride]] or [[Strike]].
