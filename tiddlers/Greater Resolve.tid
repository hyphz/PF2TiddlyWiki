Your unbelievable training grants you mental resiliency.

Your proficiency rank for [[Will]] saves increases to legendary. 

When you roll a success at a Will save, you get a critical success. When you roll a critical failure at a Will save, you get a failure instead. 

When you __roll a failure on__ a Will save against a damaging effect, you take half damage.
