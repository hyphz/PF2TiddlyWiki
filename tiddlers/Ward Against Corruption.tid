Your soul is warded against the power of undeath and plague, as well as that of the evil former psychopomps known as sahkils. 

You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against <<tag Death>> effects, <<tag Disease>>, and all effects from undead or sahkils. 

This bonus increases to +2 against an undead or sahkilâ€™s death effect or disease.
