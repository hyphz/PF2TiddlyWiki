''Requirements'' [[Precise Strike]] 6d6.

You stab your foe in a vital organ, possibly killing them outright. 

Make a [[Strike]]. On a success, you forego your [[Precise Strike]] damage from the finisher. Instead, your target takes additional precision damage based on a [[Fortitude]] save against
your class DC. 

If your Strike was a critical hit, the targetâ€™s saving throw outcome is one degree worse.
