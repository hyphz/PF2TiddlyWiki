You can exert your unsettling presence to subtly [[Demoralize]] others. When you do, Demoralize loses the <<tag Auditory>> trait and gains the <<tag Visual>> trait, and you don’t take a penalty when you attempt to Demoralize a creature that doesn’t understand your language. You also gain the [[Invigorating Fear]] reaction. Your alternate form is a fox, which has the statistics of 1st-level [[Pest Form]].
