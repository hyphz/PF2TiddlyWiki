A vaccine grants a creature immunity to a specific strain of disease of a level equal to or less than the vaccineâ€™s level, and a +2 item bonus on all saving throws against other strains of the
same disease. 

For example, a vaccine could grant immunity to filth fever inflicted by otyughs, but would only grant a +2 saving throw bonus against filth fever inflicted by a giant rat.
