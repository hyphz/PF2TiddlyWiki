''Requirements'' You wield two melee weapons, one in each hand.

You split your attacks. 

Make two melee Strikes, one with each required weapon, each against a different foe. 

If the second Strike is made with a non-agile weapon, it takes a â€“2 penalty. 

Increase your multiple attack penalty only after attempting both Strikes.
