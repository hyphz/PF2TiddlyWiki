{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

You sift through myriad potential futures, seize upon one potential moment in which the target meets a particularly gruesome and fatal end, and then show it a vision of its impending demise. The intense mental vision grows more and more terrifying to the target as the doom grows closer, and it takes 3 rounds to reach its conclusion. 

The target must attempt a [[Will]] saving throw to determine the effects. 

At the end of the spellâ€™s duration, if the target was affected, the target witnesses its death and takes 6d6 mental damage ''affected by the save''.

''Heightened (+1)'' The damage increases by 2d6.
