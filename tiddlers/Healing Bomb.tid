''Additive 2''.

''Frequency'' Once per round.

''Trigger'' You craft an [[Elixir of Life]] using [[Quick Alchemy]], and that elixir is at least 2 levels lower than your [[Advanced Alchemy]] level.

By adding a special catalyst, you transform a healing elixir into a topical projectile. 

You grant the elixir the <<tag Bomb>>trait.

If you throw an elixir of life bomb at a willing target, you hit even on a failure, though not on a critical failure. 

If your Strike with this elixir bomb hits a living target, the target regains Hit Points as if it had consumed the elixir. 

On a critical success, the target also gains the elixirâ€™s item bonus to saving throws against diseases and poisons for 1 minute.
