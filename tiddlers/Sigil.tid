{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

You harmlessly place your unique magical sigil, which is about 1 square inch in size, on the targeted creature or object. 

The mark can be visible or invisible, and you can change it from one state to another by using an [[Interact]] action to touch the target. 

The mark can be scrubbed or scraped off with 5 minutes of work. If itâ€™s on a creature, it fades 
naturally over the course of a week. The time before the mark fades increases depending on your heightened level.
