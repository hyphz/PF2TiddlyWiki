title: Mature Animal Companion (Ranger)
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Your animal companion grows up, becoming a mature animal companion, which grants it additional capabilities. 

If you have the [[Hunt Prey]] action, your animal companion assaults the prey even without your orders. During an encounter, even if you donâ€™t use the [[Command an Animal]] action, your animal companion can still use 1 action on your turn that round to [[Stride]] or [[Strike]].

//Note: the Druid version of this feat is level 4 and does not require [[Hunt Prey]] to give the bonus action to your animal companion.//
