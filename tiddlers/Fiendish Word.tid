You can call forth a blasphemous word from the fiendish realms to punish your foes. 

Once per day, you can cast [[Divine Decree]] as a 7th-level divine innate spell. You must choose evil for the spell, and you can [[Cast the Spell|Cast a Spell]] regardless of whether you have a deity or what their alignment is.
