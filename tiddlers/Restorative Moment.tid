{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

You manipulate the threads of time around the target, giving them some of the benefits of a dayâ€™s passage. 

The target decreases the values of any [[Doomed]] and [[Drained]] conditions it has by 1 and can immediately attempt one saving throw against each [[Affliction]] it has with a stage length of 1 day or less. 

The target is then temporarily immune for 1 day.
