''Trigger'' You reduce an enemy to 0 hit points.

After downing a foe, you menacingly remind another foe that youâ€™re coming after them next. 

Attempt an [[Intimidation]] check with a +2 circumstance bonus to [[Demoralize]] a single creature that you can see and that can see you. 

If you have legendary proficiency in Intimidation, you can use this as a free action with the same trigger.
