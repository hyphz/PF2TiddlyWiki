Affix to armor.

''Requirements'' You are trained in [[Athletics]].

''Trigger'' You successfully [[Trip]] a foe.

This wolf canine is bound in a strip of leather and tied to a buckle or strap of a suit of armor. 

When you activate the fang, you deal bludgeoning damage equal to your [[Strength]] modifier to the target of your [[Trip]]. 

If your Trip would already deal physical damage that doesnâ€™t include an ability modifier, add your Strength modifier to that damage.
