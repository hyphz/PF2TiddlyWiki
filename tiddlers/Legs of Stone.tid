You gain a +2 status bonus to your [[Fortitude]] and [[Reflex]] DCs against attempts to [[Shove]] or [[Trip]] you. 

You can [[Shove]] creatures even if you donâ€™t have a hand free. 

When you successfully Shove a foe, you can [[Stride]] away from your opponent (instead of toward it), but you must move the same distance in the opposite direction from where you Shoved it.
