You meander around unpredictably, and then ambush your opponents without warning. 

Choose one enemy. [[Stride]], [[Feint]] against that opponent, and then make a [[Strike]] against that foe. 

For your Feint, you can attempt a [[Stealth]] check instead of the [[Deception]] check thatâ€™s usually required, because you use the terrain around you to catch your foe off-guard.
