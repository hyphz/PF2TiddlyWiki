Affix to a weapon.

''Trigger'' You make an attack with the affixed weapon, but you havenâ€™t rolled yet.

This fluorite crystal glows with a strange phosphorescence.

When you activate {{FreeAction}} the crystal, the weapon becomes a [[+1|Weapon Potency]] [[Striking]] weapon for the rest of the turn, gaining a +1 item bonus to the attack roll and increasing the damage on a hit to two weapon damage dice.
