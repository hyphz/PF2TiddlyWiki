''Requirements'' You are in [[Wild Winds Stance]].

You store up energy and release it in an enormous gust of rushing wind. 

Make a wind crash [[Strike]] against each creature in your choice of a 30-foot [[Cone]] or a 60 foot [[Line]].

These attacks all count toward your [[Multiple Attack Penalty]], but the penalty doesnâ€™t increase until after you make all the attacks.
