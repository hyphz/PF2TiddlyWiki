''Trigger'' A foeâ€™s Strike reduces you to 0 Hit Points; you were not at 1 Hit Point and you would not be killed.

Your confidence borders on self-delusion, but it keeps you going against overwhelming odds. 

Attempt a [[Deception]] check against the attack DC of the triggering Strike. 

You take a penalty to this check equal to twice your [[Wounded]] value, if any. 

If the triggering attack was a critical hit, use the result one degree of success worse than what you rolled.

//On a succeess,// you avoid being knocked out and remain at 1 Hit Point.

//If you didn't get a critical success,// you increase your wounded value by 1.
