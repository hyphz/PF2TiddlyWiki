{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

You fill the creatureâ€™s mind with a terrifying vision out of its nightmares. 

The target must attempt a [[Will]] save.

{{||SaveSuccessTable}}

If the target is [[Unconscious]] when you Cast this Spell on it, it immediately wakes up before attempting its save, and if it fails its save, it gains the [[Fleeing]] condition for 1 round in addition to the effects noted above.

//Common sense suggests that a creature that is unconscious because it is at 0 hit points cannot be woken up by a nightmare.//
