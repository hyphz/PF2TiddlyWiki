{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

Powerful wards hide a creature from divination magic. 

The target gains a +4 status bonus to saves against <<tag Mental>>effects.

Mind Blank attempts to [[Counteract]] any <<tag Detection>>, <<tag Revelation>>, and <<tag Scrying>> effects as if its spell level were 1 higher than its actual level. 

On a success, the divination effect functions normally except that it detects nothing about the target and its possessions. For instance, [[Detect Magic]] would still detect other magic in the area, but not any magic on the target.
