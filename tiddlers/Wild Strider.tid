Natural obstacles pose no obstacle to you. 

You gain the rangerâ€™s [[Wild Stride]] class feature. 

This allows you to ignore the effects of all non-magical difficult terrain, treat greater difficult terrain as merely difficult terrain, and gives you an additional benefit from [[Favored Terrain]] based on the terrain.
