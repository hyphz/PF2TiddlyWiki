type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Your sneak attack slices through the threads binding magic to a target. 

Make a [[Strike]] against a flat-footed creature (your choice). 

If your Strike deals sneak attack damage, you attempt to [[Counteract]] a single spell active on the target.

Your counteract level is equal to your rogue level, and your counteract check modifier is equal to your class DC â€“ 10.
