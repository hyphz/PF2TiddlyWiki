Whether keeping your balance or scrambling up a tricky climb, your hairy, calloused feet easily find purchase. If you roll a success on an [[Acrobatics]] check to [[Balance]] or an [[Athletics]] check to [[Climb]], you get a critical success instead.

Youâ€™re not [[Flat-Footed]] when you attempt to Balance or Climb.
