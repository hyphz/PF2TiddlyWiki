a-fail: Your movement ends, and you trigger reactions as if you had moved out of the square you started in.
a-hit: You move through the enemy’s space, treating the squares in its space as [[Difficult Terrain]] (every 5 feet costs 10 feet of movement). If you don’t have enough Speed to move all the way through its space, you get the same effect as a failure.
