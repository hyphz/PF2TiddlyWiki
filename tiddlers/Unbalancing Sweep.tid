title: Unbalancing Sweep
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

You make a great sweep about yourself, knocking creatures off their feet and away from you. 

Choose up to three adjacent foes and choose whether to [[Shove]] or [[Trip]] all three of them.

Whichever of the two options you choose, roll a separate [[Athletics]] check against each foe, performing the same action against each foe. 

Each attempt counts toward your [[Multiple Attack Penalty]], but donâ€™t increase your penalty until you have made all the attempts.
