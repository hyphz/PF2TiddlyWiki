type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

A troop is an organized collection of component creatures, typically Small or Medium in size, working as a cohesive whole.

A troop is 16 squares in size and has two Hit Point thresholds in their HP entry, under which it reduces in size to 12 squares and then 8 squares. 

A troop has the [[Troop Defenses]], [[Form Up]], and Troop Movement abilities. //(Troop Movement varies depending on the type of Troop.)//

Most troops have a weakness to area damage. 

Because they consist of multiple discrete creatures, they canâ€™t be summoned.
