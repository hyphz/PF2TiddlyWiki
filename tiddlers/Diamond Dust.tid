{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

You supercool the nearby air, forming a cloud of dancing ice crystals in an emanation around you. 

A creature other than you that enters the area or ends its turn within the area takes 2d6 <<tag Cold>> damage. A creature can take this damage only once per turn. 

The crystals scatter and refract light; if a <<tag Light>> effect enters diamond dustâ€™s area, any creatures that effect goes on to affect gain a +2 status bonus to AC and saves against it. 

While the spell persists, you can activate or deactivate this aura by using a single action, which has the <<tag Concentrate>> trait.

You can [[Dismiss]] this spell.

''Heightened (+2)'' The damage increases by 1d6.
