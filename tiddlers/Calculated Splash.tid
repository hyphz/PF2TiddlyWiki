title: Calculated Splash
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

You have calculated all the angles to maximize a bombâ€™s splash. 

When you throw an alchemical bomb with the <<tag Splash>> trait, you can cause the bomb to deal splash damage equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 0) instead of the normal amount.
