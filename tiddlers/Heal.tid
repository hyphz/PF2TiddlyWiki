{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

You channel positive energy to heal the living or damage the undead. 

If the target is a willing living creature, you restore 1d8 Hit Points. 

If the target is <<tag Undead>>, you deal that amount of <<tag Positive>> damage to it, and it gets a basic [[Fortitude]] save. 

The number of actions you spend when Casting this Spell determines its targets, range, area, and other parameters.

{{OneAction}} (somatic) The spell has a range of touch.

{{TwoAction}} (verbal, somatic) The spell has a range of 30 feet. If youâ€™re healing a living creature, increase the Hit Points restored by 8.

{{ThreeAction}} (material, somatic, verbal) You disperse positive energy in a 30-foot [[Emanation]]. This targets all living and undead creatures in the burst.

''Heightened (+1)'' The amount of healing or damage increases by 1d8, and the extra healing for the 2-action version increases by 8.
