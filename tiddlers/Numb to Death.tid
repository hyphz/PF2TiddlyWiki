''Prerequisites'' You have died at least once.

Your past has left you numb to deathâ€™s call. 

The first time each day that you regain Hit Points while you are [[Dying]], you regain additional Hit Points equal to your level, and you neither gain the [[Wounded]] condition nor increase the value of this condition.
