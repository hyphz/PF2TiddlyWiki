type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

As long as the monster is in an area of bright light, it’s [[Dazzled]].

When first exposed to bright light, the monster is [[Blinded]] until the end of its next turn. 

After this exposure, light doesn’t blind the monster again until after it spends 1 hour in darkness. //(It does still dazzle it.)//
