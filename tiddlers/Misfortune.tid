A misfortune effect detrimentally alters how you roll your dice.

You can never have more than one misfortune effect alter a single roll. If multiple misfortune effects would apply, the GM decides which is worse and applies it. 

If a fortune effect and a misfortune effect would apply to the same roll, the two cancel
each other out, and you roll normally.
