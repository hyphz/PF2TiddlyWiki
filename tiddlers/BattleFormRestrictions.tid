//The special statistics of a battle form can be adjusted only by circumstance bonuses, status bonuses, and penalties.//

//You can't cast spells, speak, or use Manipulate actions that require hands in your battle form.//

//Your gear is absorbed into you; the constant abilities of your gear still function, but you canâ€™t activate any items.//
