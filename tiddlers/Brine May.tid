Your mother was a sea hag, granting you one sea-green or blue eye. You find comfort both in the sea and on the shore.

Whenever you roll a success on an Athletics check to [[Swim]], you get a critical success instead. 

If you end your turn in water without having succeeded at a [[Swim]] action that round, you donâ€™t sink (but you might still be moved by the current).
