{{||SpellSummaryTable}}

The target weapon becomes translucent and ghostly, and it can affect material and incorporeal creatures and objects. 

It can be wielded by a corporeal or incorporeal creature and gains the effects of the [[Ghost Touch]] property rune.

__If the weapon is magical and already has the maximum number of property runes, the wielder can choose one to suppress to gain ghost touch.__
