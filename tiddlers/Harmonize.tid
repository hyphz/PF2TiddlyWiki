You can perform multiple compositions simultaneously. 

If your next action is to cast a composition, it becomes a harmonized composition. 

Unlike a normal composition, a harmonized composition doesnâ€™t end if you cast another composition, and you can cast another composition on the same turn as a harmonized one. 

Casting another harmonized composition ends any harmonized composition you have in effect.
