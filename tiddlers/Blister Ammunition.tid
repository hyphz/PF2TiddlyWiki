Ammunition: Any.

Blister ammunition is loaded with alchemically processed irritants, such as pollen, pepper, and formic acid. 

A creature hit by activated ({{OneAction}} [[Interact]]) blister ammunition must attempt a [[Fortitude]] save or begin to itch uncontrollably in addition to damage the attack normally deals. On a critical hit, increase the [[Fortitude]] DC by 2, and the target is [[Dazzled]] for 1 round. 

For the duration, each time the target attempts a <<tag Concentrate>> action, it must attempt a DC 8 flat check, losing the action on a failure. An affected creature can use a single [[Interact]] action to scratch and sneeze, allowing it to automatically pass the flat check. 

The effect ends early once an affected creature spends 3 Interact actions scratching and sneezing. These Interact actions donâ€™t need to be consecutive.
