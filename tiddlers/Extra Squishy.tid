Your rubbery physique makes it easier for you to wedge yourself into tight spaces and more difficult for your enemies to dislodge you. 

You become trained in [[Acrobatics]]. If you would automatically become trained in Acrobatics (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. 

If you roll a success to [[Squeeze]], you get a critical success instead. 

While youâ€™re Squeezing, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to your [[Fortitude]] or [[Reflex]] DCs against attempts to [[Shove]] you or otherwise move you from your space.
