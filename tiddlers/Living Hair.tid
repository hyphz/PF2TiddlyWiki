You can instantly grow or shrink your hair, eyebrows, beard, or mustache by up to several feet and manipulate your hair for use as a weapon, though your control isnâ€™t fine enough for more dexterous tasks. 

You gain a hair unarmed attack that deals 1d4 bludgeoning damage; is in the brawling group; and has the [[Agile]], [[Disarm]], [[Finesse]], [[Trip]], and [[Unarmed]] traits.
