You know how to wield your fists as deadly weapons.

The damage die for your fist changes to 1d6 instead of 1d4. 

Most people take a –2 circumstance penalty when making a lethal attack with nonlethal unarmed attacks, because they find it hard to use their fists with deadly force. You don’t take this penalty when making a lethal attack with your fist or any other unarmed attacks.
