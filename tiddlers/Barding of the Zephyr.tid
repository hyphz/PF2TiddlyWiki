This light barding is covered in stylized wind motifs. When you suit up your animal companion, the barding adjusts to fit your animal companion regardless of its shape.

When your companion falls, wind picks it up from below; it gains the effects of [[Feather Fall]].

''Activate'' {{TwoAction}} Interact; ''Frequency'' once per day; ''Effect'' You trace a finger along the wind motifs on the barding, granting your companion wearing the barding a fly Speed of 30 feet for 10 minutes. Even if the companion doesnâ€™t have the mount special ability, it can still [[Fly]] while being ridden.
