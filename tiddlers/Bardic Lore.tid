Your studies make you informed on every subject. 

You are trained in Bardic [[Lore]], a special Lore skill that can be used only to [[Recall Knowledge]], but on any topic. 

If you have legendary proficiency in [[Occultism]], you gain expert proficiency in Bardic Lore, but you canâ€™t increase your proficiency rank in Bardic Lore by any other means.
