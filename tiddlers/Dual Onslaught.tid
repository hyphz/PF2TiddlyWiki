When you lash out with both weapons, you leave no room for the target to escape your attack. 

When you use [[Double Slice]], if you miss with both Strikes, choose one of the two weapons and apply the effects of a hit with that weapon. 

You canâ€™t choose a weapon if your attack roll with that weapon was a critical failure, meaning you still miss entirely if both attack rolls were critical failures.
