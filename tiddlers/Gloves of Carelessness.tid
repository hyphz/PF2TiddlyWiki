These gloves appear and function as [[Gloves of Storing]] but repel any item not stored in the gloves. 

When wearing them, whenever you [[Interact]] to draw or pick up an item, roll a DC 11 flat check. On a success, you do so as normal. On a failure, you instead fling the item 15 feet in a random direction. You can use a reaction to attempt a DC 23 [[Reflex]] save, causing the item to land at your feet instead if you succeed. 

Removing the stored item from the gloves does not trigger the //gloves//â€™ curse.

The first time the curse activates, the gloves fuse to you.
