Your connection to your iruxi ancestors manifests as a simple primal spell that you cast using a fragment of an ancestor’s bones. 

Choose one cantrip from the primal spell list. 

You can cast this cantrip as a primal innate spell at will, and it’s heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up.
