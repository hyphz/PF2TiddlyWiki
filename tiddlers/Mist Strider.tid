You condense the moisture in the air, solidifying it so it can hold your weight.

When you use [[Water Strider]], you can walk on air. 

You can ascend and descend at a maximum of a 45-degree angle. 

You still [[fall|Falling]] at the end of your movement if you donâ€™t end on a surface that can support you, as normal for Water Strider.
