Your ancestors spent their days cloaked and cradled in illusions, and as a result, sensing illusion magic is second nature to you. 

You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to both Perception checks and Will saves against illusions.

When you come within 10 feet of an illusion that can be disbelieved, the GM rolls a secret check for you to disbelieve it, even if you didnâ€™t spend an action to [[Interact]] with the illusion.
