''Prerequisites'' [[Divine Ally]] (blade).

Your blade ally becomes an even more powerful tool against evildoers. 

Select one foe you can see. 

Until the start of your next turn, your [[Strike]]s with the weapon your blade ally inhabits against that foe deal an extra 4 <<tag Good>> damage, increasing to 6 if you have master proficiency with this weapon.

If the foe attacks one of your allies, the duration extends to the end of that foeâ€™s next turn. 

If the foe continues to attack your allies each turn, the duration continues to extend.
