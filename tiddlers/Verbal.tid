A verbal component is a vocalization of words of power.

You must speak them in a strong voice, so it’s hard to conceal that you’re Casting a Spell. 

The spell gains the [[Concentrate]] trait. 

You must be able to speak to provide this component.

//The target does not have to be able to understand or hear you.//
