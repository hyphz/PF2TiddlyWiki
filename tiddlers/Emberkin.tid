A periâ€™s roaring spirit burns in your soul. Peris engage in constant struggle to right the wrongs of their fallen forebears, and that struggle has been passed on to you. You have a direct impulse to right wrongs and better the world. 

You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against <<tag Fire>> effects, and your perception is unaffected by non-magical flames, fog and smoke.
