You can attach a talisman using only a bit of glue and some string. 

You gain the [[Rapid Affixture]] skill feat, even if you donâ€™t meet the prerequisites. 

When you use it, you can affix or remove up to four talismans in 1 minute instead of just one.

You gain the ability to Affix a Talisman as a 3-action activity from that feat at 12th level, regardless of your Crafting proficiency.
