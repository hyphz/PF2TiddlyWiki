These sleek red boots make your legs feel like theyâ€™re bursting with energy. 

You gain a +5-foot item bonus to your land Speed and to any climb or swim Speeds you have.

''Activate'' {{OneAction}} [[Interact]]; ''Frequency'' once per day; ''Effect'' You click the heels of the boots together and gain the [[Quickened]] condition for 1 minute. You can use the extra action to [[Stride]], [[Climb]], or [[Swim]]. (You must still attempt an [[Athletics]] check for the [[Climb]] and [[Swim]] actions unless you have the appropriate movement type.)
