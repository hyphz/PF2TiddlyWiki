Your mercy transcends the bounds of life and death. 

When you use [[Mercy]], you can cast [[Lay on Hands]] on a creature that died since your last turn to return it to life. 

The target returns to life with 1 hit point and becomes [[Wounded]] 1. 

You canâ€™t use Ultimate Mercy if the triggering effect was [[Disintegrate]] or a <<tag Death>> effect.

//(Since Mercy isn't a reaction, presumably "the triggering effect" here actually means "the effect that killed the creature".)//
