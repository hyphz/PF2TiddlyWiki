You have an intuitive ability to sense hazards. 

You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [[Perception]] checks to find traps and hazards, to AC against their attacks, and to saves against their effects. 

You can find hazards that would normally require you to [[Search]] even if you arenâ€™t Searching.
